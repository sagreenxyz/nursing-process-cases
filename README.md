# Nursing Process Case Studies

A comprehensive educational resource providing realistic case studies that demonstrate the application of the nursing process across various clinical situations.

## About This Project

This repository contains case studies designed to help nursing students and educators understand and apply the five-step nursing process in diverse clinical scenarios. Each case study walks through real-world situations, guiding learners through critical thinking and clinical decision-making.

## The Nursing Process

The nursing process is a systematic, patient-centered approach to care that consists of five essential steps:

1. **Assessment** - Systematic collection of patient data (subjective and objective)
2. **Diagnosis** - Analysis of data to identify nursing diagnoses and patient problems
3. **Planning** - Setting measurable goals and expected outcomes; developing a care plan
4. **Implementation** - Executing the care plan through nursing interventions
5. **Evaluation** - Assessing the effectiveness of interventions and achievement of outcomes

- **Patient Scenario** - Detailed patient presentation including history, symptoms, and context
