# Drug Sheet: Omeprazole (Prilosec)

## Classification
**Proton Pump Inhibitor (PPI)**  
Gastric acid suppressant

---

## Mechanism of Action
Omeprazole is a proton pump inhibitor that suppresses gastric acid secretion by specifically inhibiting the H+/K+-ATPase enzyme system (proton pump) in the gastric parietal cells. This:
- Blocks the final step of acid production
- Inhibits both basal and stimulated acid secretion
- Provides prolonged acid suppression (up to 24 hours)
- Reduces gastric acid by up to 95%

---

## Indications
- Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)
- Erosive esophagitis
- Duodenal and gastric ulcers
- *Helicobacter pylori* eradication (with antibiotics)
- Zollinger-Ellison syndrome
- Prevention of NSAID-induced ulcers
- Prevention of stress ulcers in critically ill patients

---

## Dosage and Route

### For GERD:
- **Adults:** 20 mg PO once daily for 4-8 weeks
- **Maintenance:** 20 mg PO once daily

### For Erosive Esophagitis:
- **Adults:** 20 mg PO once daily for 4-8 weeks

### For Ulcer Prevention:
- **Adults:** 20-40 mg PO once daily

### Route:
- Oral (PO) only - capsule or delayed-release tablet
- IV formulation available but typically used in hospital settings only

---

## Pharmacokinetics
- **Onset of Action:** 1 hour
- **Peak Acid Suppression:** 2 hours after dose, but maximum effect takes 1-4 days
- **Duration:** Up to 24 hours (allows once-daily dosing)
- **Absorption:** Rapid; acid-labile (needs enteric coating)
- **Bioavailability:** 30-40% (first dose), increases to 60% with repeated dosing
- **Protein Binding:** 95%
- **Metabolism:** Liver (CYP2C19 and CYP3A4)
- **Excretion:** Urine (77%), feces (23%)
- **Half-life:** 0.5-1 hour (but effects last much longer)

---

## Side Effects and Adverse Reactions

### Common:
- Headache (most common)
- Abdominal pain
- Nausea, vomiting
- Diarrhea or constipation
- Flatulence
- Dizziness

### With Long-Term Use (months to years):
- **Vitamin B12 deficiency** (decreased absorption)
- **Magnesium deficiency** (hypomagnesemia)
- **Calcium malabsorption** → increased fracture risk (hip, wrist, spine)
- **Iron deficiency**
- **Increased risk of infections:**
  - *Clostridioides difficile* infection
  - Pneumonia
  - Other enteric infections

### Serious (Rare):
- Acute interstitial nephritis (kidney damage)
- Severe allergic reactions
- *Clostridioides difficile*-associated diarrhea (CDAD)
- Cutaneous and systemic lupus erythematosus
- Cyanocobalamin (vitamin B12) deficiency
- Hypomagnesemia (can lead to serious cardiac arrhythmias)
- Bone fractures (with long-term use)
- Fundic gland polyps (benign)
- Acute tubulointerstitial nephritis

---

## Contraindications
- Hypersensitivity to omeprazole or other proton pump inhibitors
- Concurrent use with rilpivirine (HIV medication)

### Use with Caution:
- Hepatic impairment (dose reduction may be needed)
- Asian patients (may need lower doses due to CYP2C19 polymorphism)
- Long-term use (increased risk of adverse effects)
- Patients at risk for osteoporosis
- Patients with magnesium deficiency

---

## Drug Interactions

### Significant Interactions:
- **Clopidogrel (Plavix):** Omeprazole reduces effectiveness (avoid combination or use pantoprazole instead)
- **Warfarin:** May increase INR and bleeding risk (monitor INR)
- **Diazepam, phenytoin:** Increased levels (omeprazole inhibits metabolism)
- **Methotrexate:** Increased methotrexate levels and toxicity
- **Digoxin:** Increased digoxin absorption and levels
- **Iron supplements, ketoconazole, itraconazole:** Decreased absorption (need acid for absorption)
- **Rilpivirine, atazanavir, nelfinavir:** Decreased antiretroviral levels (contraindicated or avoid)
- **Calcium carbonate:** Decreased calcium absorption

### Mechanism:
- Omeprazole is metabolized by CYP2C19 and CYP3A4
- Omeprazole inhibits CYP2C19 (affects drugs metabolized by this enzyme)
- Changes in gastric pH affect absorption of many drugs

## Nursing Considerations

### Before Administration:
- ✓ Assess for signs/symptoms of GERD (heartburn, regurgitation, dysphagia)
- ✓ Review medication list for interactions (especially clopidogrel, warfarin)
- ✓ Assess for history of liver disease
- ✓ Check baseline magnesium level if long-term use anticipated
- ✓ Assess for pregnancy/breastfeeding (Category C)

### Administration Guidelines:
- ✓ **Timing:** Give 30-60 minutes BEFORE first meal of the day (usually breakfast)
  - Needs to be in system when meals stimulate acid production
- ✓ **Swallow whole:** Do NOT crush, chew, or open capsule (enteric-coated)
  - If patient cannot swallow: May open capsule and sprinkle on applesauce (swallow immediately without chewing)
  - Capsule contents can be mixed with acidic juice for NG tube administration
- ✓ **With or without food:** Best taken before meals, but can be taken without food

### After Administration:
- ✓ Assess effectiveness (decreased heartburn, pain relief)
- ✓ Maximum effect may take 1-4 days
- ✓ Some patients may need 2-3 days for full relief

### Ongoing Monitoring:
- **Symptom improvement:** Assess GERD symptoms (heartburn, regurgitation)
- **Long-term use (>3 months):**
  - Magnesium levels (annually or if symptoms of hypomagnesemia)
  - Vitamin B12 levels (if long-term use >1 year)
  - Bone density (if risk factors for osteoporosis)
- **Signs of CDAD:** Diarrhea (especially if persistent)
- **Renal function:** Monitor for signs of kidney injury

## Patient Teaching

### Taking the Medication:
- **Timing is important:** "Take 30-60 minutes before breakfast or your first meal of the day."
- **Swallow whole:** "Do NOT chew, crush, or open the capsule. The coating protects the medication from stomach acid."
- **If trouble swallowing:**
  - "You can open the capsule and sprinkle the granules on a tablespoon of applesauce."
  - "Swallow immediately without chewing the granules."
  - "Follow with a glass of water."
- **Consistency:** "Take at the same time every day, even if symptoms improve."
- **Missed dose:** "Take as soon as you remember. If it's almost time for the next dose, skip the missed dose."

### How It Works:
- "This medication reduces the amount of acid your stomach produces."
- "It may take 1-4 days to feel full relief - be patient."
- "Keep taking it even when symptoms improve - it's preventing acid production."

### Duration of Treatment:
- **Short-term (4-8 weeks):** "Most people take this for 4-8 weeks initially."
- **Long-term use concerns:** "If you've been on this for months or years, talk to your doctor about whether you still need it. Long-term use has risks."
- **Trying to stop:** "Don't stop suddenly - may cause rebound acid production. Work with your doctor to taper if needed."

### Lifestyle Modifications:
- Avoid trigger foods (spicy, acidic, fatty foods)
- Eat smaller, more frequent meals
- Avoid eating 2-3 hours before bedtime
- Elevate head of bed 6-8 inches
- Maintain healthy weight
- Avoid tight clothing around waist
- Quit smoking
- Limit alcohol and caffeine

### When to Call Doctor:
- Symptoms don't improve after 2 weeks
- Difficulty swallowing
- Persistent vomiting
- Unintended weight loss
- Black, tarry stools or bloody stools
- Chest pain (not typical heartburn)
- Severe or persistent diarrhea
- Signs of low magnesium: muscle spasms, irregular heartbeat, seizures
- Signs of vitamin B12 deficiency: fatigue, weakness, numbness/tingling

### Long-Term Use Concerns:
- **Bone health:** "Long-term use may increase fracture risk. Ensure adequate calcium and vitamin D."
- **Infections:** "May slightly increase risk of intestinal infections. Practice good hand hygiene."
- **Nutrients:** "Long-term use may affect absorption of vitamin B12, magnesium, and calcium. Your doctor may check levels."

### Storage:
- Store at room temperature (59-86°F)
- Protect from moisture
- Keep in original container
- Keep out of reach of children

## Special Considerations for COPD Patients

### Why Prescribed in COPD:
- **GERD is common in COPD:** Up to 50% of COPD patients have GERD
- **GERD worsens COPD:** Aspiration of gastric contents can trigger bronchospasm and exacerbations
- **Prevention:** Reduces acid available for aspiration
- **Medication side effects:** May help with GI side effects of bronchodilators and steroids

### COPD-Specific Considerations:
- GERD symptoms may be atypical (cough, wheezing, dyspnea rather than heartburn)
- Controlling GERD may reduce COPD exacerbation frequency
- Monitor for respiratory infections (PPIs may slightly increase pneumonia risk)
- Ensure proper inhaler technique to minimize swallowed medication reaching stomach

### Interaction with COPD Medications:
- Generally safe with bronchodilators, steroids, antibiotics
- No respiratory contraindications
- May help prevent GI upset from oral steroids

---

## Clinical Pearls

- **Timing matters:** Must be taken before meals for maximum effectiveness
- **CYP2C19 genetic variation:** Some people are poor metabolizers (Asian populations) - may need lower doses; rapid metabolizers may need higher doses
- **Clopidogrel interaction:** If patient on Plavix, use pantoprazole instead
- **Rebound acid hypersecretion:** Stopping suddenly after long-term use causes increased acid production; taper if needed
- **Not for immediate relief:** Takes hours to work; patient should use antacids for immediate relief
- **Lowest effective dose:** Use lowest dose for shortest duration due to long-term risks
- **H. pylori testing:** Consider testing for H. pylori before long-term PPI therapy
- **Drug interactions common:** Review all medications due to effects on gastric pH and CYP metabolism

---

## Alternatives and Step-Down Therapy

### Treatment Ladder:
1. **Lifestyle modifications alone**
2. **Antacids or H2 blockers (ranitidine, famotidine)** - PRN or scheduled
3. **PPIs (omeprazole)** - most effective for severe GERD
4. **Surgery (fundoplication)** - for refractory cases

### Step-Down Strategy:
- After 4-8 weeks on PPI, consider:
  - Reducing to lowest effective dose
  - Switching to H2 blocker
  - PRN therapy instead of daily
  - Trial off medication with lifestyle modifications
