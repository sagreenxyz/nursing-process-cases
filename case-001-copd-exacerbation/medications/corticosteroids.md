# Drug Sheet: Corticosteroids - Methylprednisolone (Solu-Medrol) / Prednisone

## Classification
**Corticosteroid (Glucocorticoid)**  
Anti-inflammatory, immunosuppressant

---

## Mechanism of Action
Corticosteroids are synthetic analogues of cortisol that:
- **Suppress inflammation:** Inhibit phospholipase A2, reducing production of inflammatory mediators (prostaglandins, leukotrienes)
- **Stabilize cell membranes:** Prevent release of inflammatory substances
- **Decrease capillary permeability:** Reduces edema
- **Suppress immune response:** Decrease activity of lymphocytes and macrophages
- **In airways:** Reduce airway inflammation and edema, increase responsiveness to beta-agonists, decrease mucus production

---

## Indications
- Acute exacerbations of COPD
- Acute asthma exacerbations
- Allergic reactions
- Inflammatory conditions
- Autoimmune disorders
- Certain cancers
- Organ transplant rejection prevention

---

## Nursing Considerations

### Before Administration:
- ✓ Assess baseline vital signs (especially blood pressure and blood glucose)
- ✓ Obtain baseline weight
- ✓ Assess for signs of infection (corticosteroids may mask fever)
- ✓ Review history for diabetes, peptic ulcer, hypertension
- ✓ Check baseline electrolytes (especially potassium)
- ✓ For IV: Verify IV patency

### During IV Administration (Methylprednisolone):
- ✓ May give IV push over 2-5 minutes or as intermittent infusion over 15-30 minutes
- ✓ High doses should be given more slowly
- ✓ Compatible with: NS, D5W, D5NS
- ✓ Protect from light if prolonged infusion

### After Administration:
- ✓ Monitor blood glucose 1-2 hours after dose (peak hyperglycemic effect)
- ✓ Assess for hyperglycemia symptoms (increased thirst, urination)
- ✓ Monitor blood pressure
- ✓ Assess mood and sleep patterns

### Ongoing Monitoring:
- **Blood glucose:** Every 6 hours or before meals and at bedtime (especially diabetics)
- **Vital signs:** Blood pressure, heart rate (every 4-8 hours)
- **Weight:** Daily
- **Electrolytes:** Potassium, sodium (may need supplementation)
- **Signs of infection:** Temperature, WBC (steroids may mask infection)
- **GI symptoms:** Assess for abdominal pain, heartburn, GI bleeding
- **Mood and behavior:** Assess for mood changes, insomnia, anxiety
- **Therapeutic effect:** Improved respiratory status in COPD

## Patient Teaching

### Taking the Medication:
- **Oral dosing:** "Take with food or milk to decrease stomach upset."
- **Timing:** "Take in the morning to mimic natural cortisol rhythm and reduce insomnia."
- **Short course:** "For short courses (5-7 days), you typically don't need to taper - just stop after the last dose."
- **Longer courses:** "If taking for more than 2-3 weeks, DO NOT stop suddenly - must taper gradually to allow your body to start making its own cortisol again."
- **Missed dose:** "Take as soon as you remember if same day. If next day, skip and resume regular schedule."

### Side Effects to Expect:
- **Increased appetite:** "You may feel hungrier and may gain some weight. This is temporary."
- **Trouble sleeping:** "Taking medication in morning helps. Avoid caffeine late in day."
- **Mood changes:** "You may feel more energetic, irritable, or anxious. This usually improves after finishing medication."
- **Increased blood sugar:** "If diabetic, monitor blood sugar more frequently and adjust medications as directed."
- **Indigestion:** "Take with food. Antacids may help if needed."

### Call Doctor If:
- Signs of infection (fever, sore throat, productive cough)
- Severe abdominal pain or black/tarry stools
- Vision changes
- Severe mood changes or depression
- Unusual bruising or bleeding
- Severe leg pain or swelling
- Rapid weight gain or swelling
- Very high blood sugars (>300 mg/dL)

### Important Precautions:
- **Infection risk:** "Avoid people with contagious illnesses. Wash hands frequently."
- **Wound healing:** "Wounds may heal more slowly."
- **Vaccinations:** "Do not get live vaccines while taking steroids. Discuss with doctor."
- **Medical alert:** "Carry medical alert card stating you're on steroids, especially if long-term."
- **Stress dosing:** "For long-term use, may need increased dose during illness, surgery, or stress."

### Do Not:
- Stop medication abruptly (for courses >2-3 weeks)
- Take with alcohol (increases GI upset risk)
- Skip doses
- Share medication with others

### Storage:
- Store at room temperature
- Protect from moisture and light
- Keep out of reach of children

## Special Considerations for COPD Exacerbation

### Why Steroids for COPD Exacerbation:
- Reduce airway inflammation
- Decrease airway edema
- Improve response to bronchodilators
- Shorten recovery time
- Reduce risk of treatment failure
- Decrease hospital length of stay

### Evidence-Based Dosing:
- **Optimal duration:** 5 days is as effective as 14 days with fewer side effects
- **Oral = IV:** Oral prednisone as effective as IV methylprednisolone for most exacerbations
- **Dose:** 40 mg prednisone daily is standard; higher doses don't improve outcomes

### Transition Strategy:
- Start with IV if patient cannot tolerate oral or severe exacerbation
- Transition to oral when patient stable and tolerating oral intake
- No need to taper for 5-7 day courses
- Consider taper for courses >2 weeks

---

## Clinical Pearls

- **Morning dosing:** Reduces insomnia and mimics circadian cortisol rhythm
- **Short courses safe:** 5-14 days typically don't require taper or cause significant long-term effects
- **Glucose monitoring essential:** All patients need blood glucose monitoring, not just diabetics
- **GI protection:** Consider PPI if patient has risk factors for ulcers (especially if on NSAIDs)
- **Potassium supplementation:** May be needed, especially with diuretics
- **Measure effectiveness:** Improvement in respiratory symptoms, lung sounds, oxygen saturation
- **Don't withhold:** Benefits in COPD exacerbation outweigh short-term risks
- **Patient education critical:** Many patients fear steroids; explain short-term use vs long-term

---

## Tapering Guidelines

### When to Taper:
- Courses > 2-3 weeks
- Patients on chronic steroids
- High doses used

### When NOT to Taper:
- Short courses (5-14 days)
- Single dose
- First-time use

### Example Taper (if needed):
- 40 mg x 4 days
- 20 mg x 3 days
- 10 mg x 3 days
- Then discontinue

## Red Flags - Notify Provider Immediately

- ⚠️ **Signs of infection** (fever, productive cough, wound infection)
- ⚠️ **GI bleeding** (coffee-ground emesis, black tarry stools)
- ⚠️ **Severe hyperglycemia** (blood glucose >300 mg/dL, especially with symptoms)
- ⚠️ **Vision changes** (blurred vision, seeing halos)
- ⚠️ **Severe mood changes** (severe depression, suicidal thoughts, psychosis)
- ⚠️ **Severe hypertension** (BP >180/110 mmHg)
- ⚠️ **Signs of adrenal crisis after stopping** (severe weakness, confusion, hypotension - rare with short courses)

## Comparison: Methylprednisolone vs Prednisone

| Feature | Methylprednisolone | Prednisone |
|---------|-------------------|------------|
| **Route** | IV, IM | PO only |
| **Onset** | Rapid (IV) | 1-2 hours |
| **Use in hospital** | Initial treatment, NPO patients | When patient can take oral |
| **Liver function** | Active form | Requires liver conversion |
| **Potency** | 4 mg = 5 mg prednisone | 5 mg = 4 mg methylprednisolone |
| **Cost** | More expensive (IV) | Less expensive (oral) |

**Key point:** IV methylprednisolone and oral prednisone are equally effective once patient can tolerate oral intake. Switch to oral for cost-effectiveness and ease of administration.
