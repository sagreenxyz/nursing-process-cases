# Drug Sheet: Ipratropium Bromide (Atrovent)

## Classification
**Short-Acting Anticholinergic (Antimuscarinic) Bronchodilator**  
Muscarinic receptor antagonist

---

## Mechanism of Action
Ipratropium is an anticholinergic agent that blocks muscarinic (M3) receptors on bronchial smooth muscle. This action:
- Prevents acetylcholine from binding to receptors
- Inhibits vagal tone causing bronchodilation
- Reduces mucus secretion from submucosal glands
- Prevents bronchoconstriction

Unlike tiotropium (long-acting), ipratropium is short-acting with effects lasting 4-6 hours.

---

## Indications
- Maintenance therapy for COPD (chronic bronchitis and emphysema)
- Treatment of acute bronchospasm
- Combination therapy with beta-2 agonists for COPD exacerbations
- Acute asthma exacerbations (adjunct to SABAs)
- NOT first-line for stable asthma

---

## Dosage and Route

### Nebulizer Solution:
- **Adults:** 0.5 mg (1 vial) via nebulizer every 6-8 hours
- **Acute exacerbation:** May increase to every 4 hours or more frequently
- **Often combined with albuterol** in same nebulizer treatment

### Metered Dose Inhaler (MDI):
- **Adults:** 2 inhalations (17 mcg/puff = 34 mcg) 4 times daily
- **Maximum:** 12 inhalations per 24 hours

### Route:
- Oral inhalation only (nebulizer or MDI)

---

## Pharmacokinetics
- **Onset of Action:** 5-15 minutes
- **Peak Effect:** 1-2 hours
- **Duration:** 4-6 hours
- **Absorption:** Minimal systemic absorption (≤10% of inhaled dose)
- **Metabolism:** Minimal (mostly excreted unchanged)
- **Excretion:** Primarily via feces and urine
- **Half-life:** 2 hours

---

## Side Effects and Adverse Reactions

### Common:
- Dry mouth (most common)
- Cough
- Headache
- Dizziness
- Nausea
- Throat irritation
- Metallic or bitter taste
- Blurred vision (if sprayed in eyes)

### Less Common but Important:
- Urinary retention (especially in elderly males with BPH)
- Tachycardia
- Palpitations
- Constipation
- Nervousness

### Serious (Rare):
- Paradoxical bronchospasm
- Acute angle-closure glaucoma (if mist gets in eyes)
- Hypersensitivity reactions (rash, angioedema, bronchospasm)
- Urinary retention/bladder obstruction

---

## Contraindications
- Hypersensitivity to ipratropium, atropine, or derivatives
- Hypersensitivity to soya lecithin or related food products (peanut, soybean) - for MDI formulation

### Use with Caution:
- Narrow-angle glaucoma
- Prostatic hyperplasia or bladder neck obstruction
- Urinary retention

---

## Drug Interactions
- **Other anticholinergics (tiotropium, atropine):** Additive anticholinergic effects (avoid duplication)
- **Anticholinergic medications:** May increase risk of anticholinergic side effects
- **Few significant drug interactions** due to minimal systemic absorption

**Note:** Ipratropium can be safely combined with beta-2 agonists (albuterol) and is often more effective together.

---

## Nursing Considerations

### Before Administration:
- ✓ Assess respiratory status (lung sounds, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation)
- ✓ Assess for contraindications (glaucoma, urinary retention, BPH)
- ✓ Review allergy history (atropine, peanut/soy for MDI)
- ✓ Check if patient is already on long-acting anticholinergic (tiotropium)

### During Nebulizer Administration:
- ✓ Mix nebulizer solution immediately before use
- ✓ Can be mixed with albuterol in same nebulizer cup
- ✓ Administer via mouthpiece or face mask
- ✓ **Critical:** Ensure patient keeps eyes closed if using mask (prevent eye exposure)
- ✓ Treatment typically takes 10-15 minutes
- ✓ Encourage patient to breathe normally through mouth

### During MDI Administration:
- ✓ Shake well before each use
- ✓ Prime if new or not used for >3 days (spray 2 test sprays)
- ✓ Proper technique: Breathe out fully, inhale slowly while pressing canister, hold breath 10 seconds
- ✓ Wait 15 seconds between puffs
- ✓ Avoid spraying in eyes

### After Administration:
- ✓ Assess respiratory status 15-30 minutes after administration
- ✓ Document effectiveness (improved breath sounds, decreased dyspnea)
- ✓ Assess for side effects (dry mouth, urinary retention)
- ✓ Have patient rinse mouth to reduce dry mouth

### Ongoing Monitoring:
- Respiratory assessment (lung sounds, RR, SpO2, dyspnea level)
- Urinary output (especially in elderly males)
- Vision (if patient complains of eye pain or visual changes)
- Heart rate (may cause mild tachycardia)

## Patient Teaching

### Proper Nebulizer Technique:
1. "Wash hands before preparing treatment."
2. "Place medication in nebulizer cup (can mix with albuterol if ordered)."
3. "Connect tubing to air compressor."
4. "Sit upright in comfortable position."
5. "Place mouthpiece between teeth and close lips around it (or place mask snugly over nose and mouth)."
6. **"IMPORTANT: Keep eyes closed if using mask - medication can harm eyes."**
7. "Breathe normally through mouth."
8. "Continue until medication is gone and mist stops (about 10-15 minutes)."
9. "Rinse mouth with water after treatment."
10. "Clean nebulizer equipment after each use."

### Proper MDI Technique:
1. "Remove cap and shake inhaler well."
2. "Breathe out completely."
3. "Place mouthpiece between lips."
4. "Press down on canister while breathing in slowly."
5. "Hold breath for 10 seconds."
6. "Wait 15 seconds, then take second puff if prescribed."
7. "Rinse mouth with water after use."

### General Instructions:
- **Purpose:** "This medication helps open your airways by relaxing the muscles around them. It works differently than albuterol but they work well together."
- **Scheduled use:** "Use regularly at scheduled times, even when breathing feels good. This prevents symptoms."
- **Not for quick relief:** "This works more slowly than albuterol. If you need quick relief, use your albuterol inhaler."
- **Dry mouth:** "This commonly causes dry mouth. Sip water frequently, suck on sugar-free candy, or chew sugar-free gum."

### Managing Side Effects:
- **Dry mouth:**
  - Sip water throughout the day
  - Sugar-free candy or gum
  - Good oral hygiene
- **Urinary problems:** "Call doctor if you have trouble urinating or pain with urination."
- **Vision problems:** "Avoid getting medication in your eyes. If mist gets in eyes and you develop eye pain or vision changes, seek medical attention."

### Call Doctor If:
- Difficulty breathing worsens
- Medication not helping as much as usual
- Difficulty urinating
- Eye pain or vision changes
- Severe dizziness or fainting
- Rapid or irregular heartbeat
- Allergic reaction (rash, swelling, difficulty breathing)

### Storage:
- Store at room temperature (59-86°F)
- Protect from light
- Do not freeze nebulizer solution
- Keep vials in foil pouch until ready to use
- Keep out of reach of children

### Safety:
- Do NOT spray in eyes
- Close eyes if using nebulizer with face mask
- Do not exceed prescribed dose
- Clean nebulizer equipment daily

## Combination Therapy: Ipratropium + Albuterol

### Why Combine?
- **Synergistic effect:** Work through different mechanisms
- **Better bronchodilation:** More effective together than either alone
- **Faster improvement:** Especially in acute exacerbations
- **Standard practice:** Often combined for COPD exacerbations

### Duoneb (Combination Product):
- Contains both ipratropium (0.5 mg) and albuterol (3 mg) in one vial
- Convenient for patients requiring both medications
- Same administration technique as individual medications

### Timing:
- Both can be given in same nebulizer treatment
- If separate, may give within minutes of each other
- No need to space apart

---

## Special Considerations for COPD Patients

### Role in COPD:
- **Maintenance therapy:** Short-acting anticholinergic for symptom control
- **Exacerbations:** Increased frequency during flare-ups
- **Combination therapy:** Often combined with SABAs for better control
- **Transition:** May use short-acting while waiting for long-acting (tiotropium) to reach full effect

### COPD-Specific Teaching:
- "Anticholinergics are often more effective than beta-agonists alone in COPD."
- "You may be on both short-acting (ipratropium) and long-acting (tiotropium) anticholinergics - do NOT confuse them."
- "Short-acting = every 6 hours as needed or scheduled"
- "Long-acting (Spiriva) = once daily for prevention"

### Elderly COPD Patients:
- Monitor urinary retention closely (common in elderly males with BPH)
- Assess for constipation
- May have increased sensitivity to anticholinergic effects
- Ensure proper eye protection with nebulizer mask

---

## Clinical Pearls

- **Minimal systemic effects:** Very little absorption makes it safe for cardiac patients
- **Slower onset than albuterol:** Takes longer to work (15 min vs 5 min)
- **Longer duration:** Effects last slightly longer than albuterol
- **Eye protection critical:** Angle-closure glaucoma is serious complication
- **Dry mouth is expected:** Most common side effect, usually tolerable
- **Can mix medications:** Safe to mix with albuterol in same nebulizer cup
- **Bitter taste common:** Rinsing mouth helps
- **Not absorbed systemically:** Less likely to cause tremor and tachycardia than albuterol

---

## Red Flags - Notify Provider Immediately

- ⚠️ **Paradoxical bronchospasm** (worsening breathing after treatment)
- ⚠️ **Eye pain with vision changes** (possible acute glaucoma)
- ⚠️ **Inability to urinate** (urinary retention)
- ⚠️ **Severe allergic reaction** (rash, swelling, severe bronchospasm)
- ⚠️ **Chest pain or severe palpitations**

## Case Application: Mr. Martinez

**Prescribed:** Ipratropium bromide 0.5 mg via nebulizer every 6 hours

**Rationale for this patient:**
- Anticholinergic bronchodilator for COPD exacerbation
- Complements albuterol therapy (different mechanism)
- Provides sustained bronchodilation
- Standard therapy for moderate-severe COPD exacerbations

**Why both ipratropium AND tiotropium?**
- **Short-term:** Ipratropium for acute exacerbation (higher frequency, immediate effect)
- **Long-term:** Tiotropium for maintenance (once daily, prevention)
- During exacerbation, short-acting used more frequently
- As patient improves, ipratropium reduced/discontinued, tiotropium continued

**Nursing considerations specific to Mr. Martinez:**
- ✓ **Age 68, male:** Monitor for urinary retention (no BPH history noted)
- ✓ **Lives alone:** Important to master technique independently
- ✓ **Combined with albuterol:** Mixed in same nebulizer cup for efficiency
- ✓ **Scheduled dosing:** Every 6 hours during hospitalization
- ✓ **Eye protection:** Patient educated to keep eyes closed during treatments

**Administration during hospitalization:**
- Combined ipratropium 0.5 mg + albuterol 2.5 mg nebulizers
- Given at 10 AM, 4 PM, 10 PM, 4 AM schedule
- Patient tolerated treatments well
- No adverse effects noted
- Respiratory status improved after each treatment

**Monitoring completed:**
- Lung sounds improved (decreased wheezing)
- Respiratory rate decreased from 28 to 18/min
- Oxygen saturation improved from 88% to 95%
- No urinary retention
- Dry mouth managed with frequent sips of water
- No eye complications

**Transition plan:**
- Ipratropium discontinued at discharge
- Patient to continue with:
  - Albuterol PRN for quick relief
  - Tiotropium daily for long-term control
- Combination only needed during acute exacerbation
- Home health nurse to monitor for need to restart if exacerbation recurs

**Patient education provided:**
- ✓ Why two anticholinergics during hospitalization
- ✓ Difference between short-acting (ipratropium) and long-acting (tiotropium)
- ✓ May need ipratropium again during future exacerbations
- ✓ Report increased dyspnea requiring more frequent albuterol use

## Comparison: Ipratropium vs Tiotropium

| Feature | Ipratropium (Atrovent) | Tiotropium (Spiriva) |
|---------|----------------------|---------------------|
| **Duration** | Short-acting (4-6 hrs) | Long-acting (24+ hrs) |
| **Frequency** | Every 6-8 hours | Once daily |
| **Use** | Acute relief & maintenance | Maintenance only |
| **Onset** | 5-15 minutes | 30 minutes |
| **Best for** | Exacerbations, acute symptoms | Daily prevention |
| **Receptor binding** | Quick dissociation | Slow dissociation (prolonged effect) |
| **Device** | Nebulizer or MDI | HandiHaler or Respimat |

**Key teaching:** "Ipratropium is for when you need help now or during a flare-up (short-term). Tiotropium is for every day to keep your lungs healthy (long-term)."
