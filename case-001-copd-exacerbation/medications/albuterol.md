# Drug Sheet: Albuterol (Proventil, Ventolin)

## Classification
**Short-Acting Beta-2 Adrenergic Agonist (SABA)**  
Bronchodilator

---

## Mechanism of Action
Albuterol selectively stimulates beta-2 adrenergic receptors in the lungs, causing relaxation of bronchial smooth muscle. This results in bronchodilation and relief of bronchospasm. It also inhibits release of mediators from mast cells in the airways.

---

## Indications
- Treatment and prevention of bronchospasm in patients with reversible obstructive airway disease (asthma, COPD)
- Prevention of exercise-induced bronchospasm
- Acute treatment of bronchospasm/wheezing

---

## Dosage and Route

### Metered Dose Inhaler (MDI):
- **Adults:** 2 puffs (90 mcg/puff = 180 mcg) every 4-6 hours as needed
- **Maximum:** 12 puffs per day

### Nebulizer Solution:
- **Adults:** 2.5 mg in 3 mL of 0.9% NaCl every 4-6 hours as needed
- **Acute severe bronchospasm:** May give every 20 minutes for 3 doses, then reassess

### Route:
- Oral inhalation (MDI or nebulizer)

---

## Pharmacokinetics
- **Onset of Action:** 5-15 minutes (inhaled)
- **Peak Effect:** 30-60 minutes (inhaled)
- **Duration:** 4-6 hours (inhaled)
- **Metabolism:** Liver
- **Excretion:** Urine

---

## Side Effects and Adverse Reactions

### Common:
- Tremor (especially hands)
- Nervousness/anxiety
- Headache
- Tachycardia
- Palpitations
- Dizziness
- Throat irritation
- Muscle cramps

### Serious (Less Common):
- Paradoxical bronchospasm
- Hypokalemia (with excessive use)
- Hyperglycemia
- Cardiac arrhythmias
- Angina
- Hypertension

---

## Contraindications
- Hypersensitivity to albuterol or any component
- Use with caution in:
  - Cardiovascular disorders (hypertension, coronary artery disease, arrhythmias)
  - Diabetes mellitus
  - Hyperthyroidism
  - Seizure disorders

---

## Drug Interactions
- **Beta-blockers:** May antagonize bronchodilator effect
- **MAO inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants:** Increased cardiovascular effects
- **Diuretics:** May potentiate hypokalemia
- **Digoxin:** Hypokalemia may increase risk of digoxin toxicity
- **Other sympathomimetics:** Additive effects, increased risk of adverse effects

---

## Nursing Considerations

### Before Administration:
- ✓ Assess lung sounds, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation
- ✓ Assess for history of cardiac disease
- ✓ Obtain baseline vital signs (especially heart rate and blood pressure)
- ✓ Review medication history for beta-blockers

### During Administration:
- ✓ Proper inhaler technique: Shake well, exhale fully, place mouthpiece in mouth, press canister while inhaling slowly and deeply, hold breath 10 seconds
- ✓ For MDI: Wait 1-2 minutes between puffs
- ✓ For nebulizer: Monitor patient throughout treatment (approximately 10-15 minutes)

### After Administration:
- ✓ Assess respiratory status 15-30 minutes after administration
- ✓ Monitor heart rate and rhythm (especially in elderly or those with cardiac disease)
- ✓ Document effectiveness (decreased wheezing, improved respiratory rate, improved oxygen saturation)
- ✓ Assess for side effects (tremor, tachycardia)
- ✓ Monitor for signs of medication overuse (increasing need for rescue inhaler may indicate poor control)

### Ongoing Monitoring:
- Respiratory assessment
- Vital signs (especially heart rate)
- Oxygen saturation
- Serum potassium (with frequent or continuous use)
- Blood glucose in diabetic patients

## Patient Teaching

### Proper Inhaler Technique (MDI):
1. Remove cap and shake inhaler well
2. Breathe out completely
3. Place mouthpiece between lips (or use spacer if prescribed)
4. Press down on canister while starting to breathe in slowly and deeply
5. Hold breath for 10 seconds
6. Wait 1-2 minutes before second puff if prescribed
7. Rinse mouth with water after use
8. Replace cap

### General Instructions:
- **Purpose:** "This medication opens up your airways to help you breathe easier."
- **When to use:** "Use this inhaler when you feel short of breath or wheezing, or before exercise if prescribed."
- **Not a controller:** "This is a rescue medication for quick relief. It does NOT prevent attacks or replace daily controller medications."
- **Rinse mouth:** "Rinse your mouth with water after using to prevent throat irritation."
- **Track usage:** "If you need to use this more than 2 times per week (except before exercise), call your doctor - your COPD/asthma may not be well controlled."
- **When to call doctor:**
  - Using inhaler more frequently without relief
  - Symptoms worsen despite medication
  - Fast or irregular heartbeat
  - Chest pain
  - Severe dizziness or fainting

### Storage:
- Store at room temperature (59-86°F)
- Protect from light and extreme heat
- Do not puncture or throw canister in fire
- Keep out of reach of children
- Check expiration date regularly
- Keep track of doses used (many inhalers have dose counters)

### Safety:
- Avoid spraying in eyes
- Do not exceed prescribed dose
- Inform healthcare providers that you use this medication before any procedures

## Special Considerations for COPD Patients

- **Monitor carefully for cardiac effects:** COPD patients often have comorbid heart disease
- **Oxygen saturation:** May improve oxygenation but monitor for CO2 retention
- **Overuse warning:** Increased use may indicate exacerbation requiring medical attention
- **Combine with anticholinergic:** Often more effective when used with ipratropium in COPD
- **Not first-line controller:** COPD patients need long-acting bronchodilators (like tiotropium) for maintenance

---

## Clinical Pearls

- **Tremor is expected:** Fine hand tremor is a common side effect and usually decreases with continued use
- **Spacers improve delivery:** Especially helpful for elderly or those with coordination difficulties
- **Check technique regularly:** Many patients use inhalers incorrectly
- **Prime new inhaler:** New inhalers should be primed (spray into air 4 times) before first use
- **Clean weekly:** Clean mouthpiece weekly with warm water and let air dry
- **Count doses:** Most inhalers contain 200 doses; track to know when to refill

---

## Red Flags - Notify Provider Immediately

- ⚠️ Paradoxical bronchospasm (worsening wheezing after use)
- ⚠️ Chest pain or severe palpitations
- ⚠️ No relief from usual dose
- ⚠️ Need for more frequent dosing
- ⚠️ Severe tremor or anxiety
- ⚠️ Irregular heartbeat

## Case Application: Mr. Martinez

**Prescribed:** Albuterol 90 mcg, 2 puffs every 4-6 hours as needed

**Rationale for this patient:**
- Provides quick relief of bronchospasm during COPD exacerbation
- Rescue medication for acute dyspnea episodes
- Used in combination with long-acting bronchodilators

**Nursing considerations specific to Mr. Martinez:**
- Monitor heart rate carefully (history of hypertension)
- Teach proper inhaler technique (demonstrated correctly after coaching)
- Reinforce this is PRN medication, not scheduled
- Discuss not waiting until severe dyspnea to use medication
- Track usage to identify patterns of worsening

**Expected outcomes:**
- Decreased wheezing and dyspnea within 15 minutes
- Improved ability to clear secretions
- Improved oxygen saturation
- Increased exercise tolerance
