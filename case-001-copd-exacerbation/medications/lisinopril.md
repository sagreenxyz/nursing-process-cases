# Drug Sheet: Lisinopril (Prinivil, Zestril)

## Classification
**Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme (ACE) Inhibitor**  
Antihypertensive, cardioprotective agent

---

## Mechanism of Action
Lisinopril inhibits angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), preventing conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II. This results in:
- **Vasodilation:** Decreased angiotensin II leads to relaxation of blood vessels
- **Decreased aldosterone secretion:** Reduces sodium and water retention
- **Decreased blood pressure:** Lower peripheral vascular resistance
- **Decreased cardiac workload:** Reduced afterload
- **Renal protection:** Decreases intraglomerular pressure

---

## Indications
- Hypertension (first-line therapy)
- Heart failure (reduces mortality)
- Post-myocardial infarction (improves survival)
- Diabetic nephropathy (slows progression)
- Chronic kidney disease (renal protection)

---

## Dosage and Route

### For Hypertension:
- **Initial dose:** 10 mg PO once daily
- **Maintenance:** 20-40 mg PO once daily
- **Maximum:** 80 mg per day

### Route:

---

## Nursing Considerations

### Before Administration:
- ✓ Obtain baseline blood pressure (both sitting and standing)
- ✓ Assess for history of angioedema or ACE inhibitor allergy
- ✓ Check baseline labs: BUN, creatinine, potassium
- ✓ Assess volume status/hydration
- ✓ **Ask females of childbearing age about pregnancy status**
- ✓ Review medication list for interactions (especially potassium supplements, NSAIDs)

### First Dose Considerations:
- ✓ First-dose hypotension can occur (especially in volume-depleted patients)
- ✓ Consider giving at bedtime initially
- ✓ Monitor blood pressure 2-6 hours after first dose

### After Administration:
- ✓ Monitor blood pressure 1-2 hours after dose
- ✓ Assess for signs of hypotension (dizziness, lightheadedness, syncope)
- ✓ Check for signs of angioedema (facial swelling, tongue swelling, difficulty breathing)

### Ongoing Monitoring:
- **Blood pressure:** Regularly (goal typically <130/80 mmHg)
- **Renal function:** BUN, creatinine at baseline, 2-3 weeks after starting, then periodically
  - Watch for increased creatinine (up to 30% increase may be acceptable)
- **Potassium levels:** Baseline, 2-3 weeks after starting, then periodically
  - Watch for hyperkalemia (K+ >5.5 mEq/L)
- **Signs of angioedema:** Assess face, lips, tongue, throat at each visit
- **Cough:** Assess for development of dry, persistent cough

## Patient Teaching

### Taking the Medication:
- **Consistency:** "Take at the same time each day, preferably in the evening."
- **With or without food:** "Can be taken with or without food - choose what works best for you."
- **Missed dose:** "If you miss a dose, take it as soon as you remember. If it's almost time for next dose, skip the missed dose. Never double up."
- **Don't stop suddenly:** "Don't stop taking this medication without talking to your doctor, even if you feel fine."

### Blood Pressure Monitoring:
- "Blood pressure medications work even when you feel well."
- "Keep taking medication even if blood pressure is normal - that means it's working."
- "Consider getting a home blood pressure monitor and checking regularly."
- "Bring blood pressure log to appointments."

### Lifestyle Modifications:
- **Diet:** "Limit salt intake. Avoid salt substitutes - they contain potassium."
- **Potassium:** "Don't take potassium supplements unless doctor prescribes them."
- **Weight:** "Maintain healthy weight - helps blood pressure control."
- **Exercise:** "Regular exercise helps, but rise slowly from lying or sitting to prevent dizziness."
- **Alcohol:** "Limit alcohol - can lower blood pressure too much."

### Managing Side Effects:
- **Dizziness/lightheadedness:**
  - Rise slowly from lying or sitting position
  - Sit or lie down if dizzy
  - Usually improves after first few weeks
- **Dry cough:**
  - May develop after weeks to months
  - Does not improve with cough medicine
  - Tell doctor - may need to switch medications
  - Not harmful but can be bothersome

### SERIOUS - Call Doctor Immediately or Go to ER:
- ⚠️ **Swelling of face, lips, tongue, throat, hands, feet** (angioedema)
- ⚠️ **Difficulty breathing or swallowing**
- ⚠️ **Severe dizziness or fainting**
- ⚠️ **Irregular heartbeat or palpitations**
- ⚠️ **Chest pain**
- ⚠️ **Signs of high potassium:** muscle weakness, slow/irregular heartbeat, tingling
- ⚠️ **Signs of infection:** fever, sore throat (possible low white blood cell count)
- ⚠️ **Yellow skin or eyes** (liver problem)
- ⚠️ **Decreased urination or swelling** (kidney problem)

### Pregnancy Warning:
- **Critical for women of childbearing age:** "This medication can harm or kill an unborn baby. Use effective birth control. If you become pregnant or plan to become pregnant, tell your doctor immediately."

### Surgery/Dental Procedures:
- "Tell all healthcare providers and dentists that you take this medication before any procedure."

### Storage:
- Store at room temperature (59-86°F)
- Protect from moisture and excessive heat
- Keep in original container
- Keep out of reach of children

## Special Considerations for COPD Patients

### Benefits in COPD:
- Controls hypertension (common comorbidity in COPD)
- Cardioprotective effects important for COPD patients (high cardiovascular risk)
- Does NOT worsen respiratory function (unlike beta-blockers)
- May have mild protective effects on pulmonary vasculature

### Considerations:
- Safe to use in COPD (no bronchospasm risk)
- Monitor for cough - ACE inhibitor cough can be confused with COPD symptoms
- Ensure adequate hydration, especially during COPD exacerbations
- Monitor renal function carefully if patient dehydrated during exacerbation

---

## Clinical Pearls

- **Cough is common:** 10-20% of patients develop dry, persistent cough; switching to ARB (angiotensin receptor blocker) often solves problem
- **Angioedema is rare but serious:** Higher risk in Black patients; can occur anytime, even after years of therapy
- **Check potassium:** Especially important in elderly, diabetics, those with renal disease, or on potassium supplements
- **Renal function:** Small increase in creatinine (up to 30%) is acceptable and indicates appropriate kidney response
- **First-dose effect:** Hypotension more likely in volume-depleted patients; ensure adequate hydration
- **Once daily dosing:** Excellent compliance; consistent blood pressure control
- **No hepatic metabolism:** Preferred in liver disease
- **Not dialyzable:** Extra dose after dialysis needed
- **Combination therapy:** Often combined with diuretics or calcium channel blockers for better BP control

## ACE Inhibitor Cough vs Respiratory Cough

### ACE Inhibitor Cough Characteristics:
- Dry, non-productive
- Tickling sensation in throat
- Worse at night
- Not relieved by cough suppressants
- No sputum production
- Develops weeks to months after starting
- Resolves within days to weeks after stopping

### COPD/Respiratory Cough:
- Often productive
- Associated with dyspnea
- Sputum production (white, yellow, or green)
- Responds to bronchodilators
- Associated with wheezing or abnormal lung sounds

**Key point:** If uncertain, ACE inhibitor cough is diagnosis of exclusion after ruling out respiratory causes.

## Red Flags - Notify Provider Immediately

- ⚠️ **Angioedema** (face, lip, tongue, throat swelling) - **MEDICAL EMERGENCY**
- ⚠️ **Difficulty breathing or swallowing**
- ⚠️ **Severe hypotension** (systolic BP <90 mmHg with symptoms)
- ⚠️ **Syncope** (fainting)
- ⚠️ **Hyperkalemia symptoms** (weakness, irregular heartbeat, paresthesias)
- ⚠️ **Acute kidney injury** (decreased urination, edema, confusion)
- ⚠️ **Pregnancy**
- ⚠️ **Signs of infection with neutropenia** (fever, sore throat)
