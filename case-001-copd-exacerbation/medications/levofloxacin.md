# Drug Sheet: Levofloxacin (Levaquin)

## Classification
**Fluoroquinolone Antibiotic**  
Broad-spectrum antimicrobial agent

---

## Mechanism of Action
Levofloxacin inhibits bacterial DNA gyrase (topoisomerase II) and topoisomerase IV, enzymes essential for bacterial DNA replication, transcription, repair, and recombination. This leads to bacterial cell death.

**Spectrum of Activity:**
- Gram-positive organisms (including Streptococcus pneumoniae)
- Gram-negative organisms
- Atypical respiratory pathogens (Mycoplasma, Legionella, Chlamydia)

---

## Indications
- Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP)
- Hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP)
- Acute bacterial exacerbation of chronic bronchitis
- Acute sinusitis
- Complicated and uncomplicated urinary tract infections
- Skin and soft tissue infections
- Inhalational anthrax (post-exposure)

---

## Patient Teaching

### Taking the Medication:
- **Complete the full course:** "Take all of your antibiotic, even if you feel better. Stopping early can cause the infection to come back stronger."
- **Timing:** "Take at the same time each day to maintain steady levels."
- **With or without food:** "Can be taken with or without food, but take with plenty of water."
- **Missed dose:** "If you miss a dose, take it as soon as you remember. If it's almost time for the next dose, skip the missed dose. Never double up."

### Important Interactions:
- **Antacids and supplements:** "Don't take antacids, calcium, iron, or zinc within 2 hours before or 2 hours after levofloxacin."
- **Dairy products:** "Avoid taking with dairy products or calcium-fortified juices - separate by 2 hours."

### Serious Side Effects - Call Doctor Immediately:
- **Tendon problems:** "STOP taking medication and call doctor right away if you have:"
  - Pain, swelling, or inflammation in a tendon
  - Sudden pop or snap in a tendon
  - Difficulty bearing weight or moving
  - Bruising after tendon injury
- **Nerve problems:** "STOP and call doctor if you have:"
  - Numbness, tingling, burning pain in hands, arms, legs, or feet
  - Weakness
  - Changes in sensation to light touch, pain, temperature, or sense of body position
- **CNS effects:** "Call doctor if you have:"
  - Seizures
  - Confusion, hallucinations
  - Severe headache
  - Tremors, restlessness, anxiety
  - Depression or suicidal thoughts
- **Diarrhea:** "Call if you develop watery or bloody diarrhea, even weeks after finishing the antibiotic."
- **Allergic reaction:** "Seek emergency care for:"
  - Rash, hives, itching
  - Swelling of face, lips, tongue, throat
  - Difficulty breathing
- **Blood sugar changes:** "Monitor blood sugar closely if diabetic."

### General Precautions:
- **Sun exposure:** "Avoid prolonged sun exposure and tanning beds. Use sunscreen (SPF 30+) and protective clothing. You may burn more easily."
- **Hydration:** "Drink plenty of fluids (8-10 glasses of water daily) unless told otherwise."
- **Activity:** "Avoid strenuous exercise and heavy lifting while taking this medication - increases tendon rupture risk."
- **Report all medications:** "Tell all doctors and dentists you're taking this medication."

### Storage:
- Store at room temperature (59-86°F)
- Protect from light
- Keep in original container
- Keep out of reach of children

## Special Considerations for COPD/Pneumonia Patients

### Why This Drug for Respiratory Infections:
- Excellent lung tissue penetration
- Covers common CAP pathogens including Streptococcus pneumoniae
- Once-daily dosing improves compliance
- Can transition from IV to oral without dose change

### Monitoring in Respiratory Patients:
- Assess respiratory status regularly (lung sounds, RR, SpO2)
- Monitor temperature trends
- Assess sputum characteristics (color, consistency, amount)
- WBC count should decrease
- Clinical improvement typically seen within 48-72 hours

### COPD-Specific Concerns:
- Many COPD patients are elderly - higher tendon rupture risk
- Often on corticosteroids for exacerbations - compounds tendon risk
- May have comorbid diabetes - monitor glucose closely
- Often have cardiac disease - monitor for QT prolongation

---

## Clinical Pearls

- **Black Box Warnings are serious:** Counsel ALL patients about tendon rupture and peripheral neuropathy risks
- **High-risk patients:** Especially counsel elderly, those on steroids, transplant recipients
- **Culture before antibiotics:** Always obtain culture before starting, but don't delay treatment
- **IV to PO switch:** Excellent oral bioavailability allows easy transition when patient stable
- **Resistance concerns:** Fluoroquinolones should be reserved for appropriate indications due to resistance and adverse effect profile
- **Alternative for penicillin allergy:** Good choice when patient allergic to beta-lactams
- **Hydration important:** Helps prevent crystalluria and maintains renal function
- **Photosensitivity common:** Sunburn can occur within minutes of sun exposure

## Red Flags - STOP DRUG and Notify Provider Immediately

- ⚠️ **Tendon pain, swelling, or inflammation** (especially Achilles)
- ⚠️ **Peripheral neuropathy symptoms** (numbness, tingling, burning in extremities)
- ⚠️ **Severe allergic reaction** (anaphylaxis, severe rash, difficulty breathing)
- ⚠️ **Watery or bloody diarrhea** (possible C. difficile)
- ⚠️ **Seizures or severe CNS effects**
- ⚠️ **Irregular heartbeat, palpitations, fainting** (possible QT prolongation)
- ⚠️ **Signs of liver problems** (jaundice, dark urine, severe fatigue)
- ⚠️ **Worsening muscle weakness** (in myasthenia gravis patients)
