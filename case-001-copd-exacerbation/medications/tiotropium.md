# Drug Sheet: Tiotropium (Spiriva)

## Classification
**Long-Acting Anticholinergic (Antimuscarinic) Bronchodilator**  
Muscarinic receptor antagonist

---

## Mechanism of Action
Tiotropium is a long-acting anticholinergic that competitively and reversibly inhibits muscarinic receptors (M3 receptors) in bronchial smooth muscle. This inhibition prevents acetylcholine from binding, resulting in:
- Bronchodilation
- Decreased mucus secretion
- Prevention of bronchoconstriction

The drug has a slow dissociation from M3 receptors, providing prolonged bronchodilation (24+ hours).

---

## Indications
- Long-term maintenance treatment of COPD (including chronic bronchitis and emphysema)
- Reduction of COPD exacerbations
- NOT for acute bronchospasm or asthma as monotherapy

---

## Dosage and Route

### HandiHaler (Dry Powder Inhaler):
- **Adults:** 18 mcg (1 capsule) inhaled once daily via HandiHaler device
- Capsules are for inhalation only - do NOT swallow

### Respimat (Soft Mist Inhaler):
- **Adults:** 2 inhalations of 2.5 mcg (5 mcg total) once daily

### Route:
- Oral inhalation only

---

## Pharmacokinetics
- **Onset of Action:** 30 minutes
- **Peak Effect:** 1-2 hours
- **Duration:** 24+ hours
- **Metabolism:** Minimal metabolism (74% excreted unchanged)
- **Excretion:** Primarily urine (14%), feces (unchanged)
- **Half-life:** 5-6 days (accounts for prolonged effects)

---

---

## Drug Interactions
- **Other anticholinergics (ipratropium, atropine):** Additive anticholinergic effects
- **Anticholinergic medications:** May increase risk of anticholinergic side effects
- **Generally has few drug interactions due to minimal systemic absorption**

---

## Nursing Considerations

### Before Administration:
- ✓ Assess respiratory status (lung sounds, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation)
- ✓ Review patient history for glaucoma or urinary retention
- ✓ Assess for signs of infection (common side effect)
- ✓ Verify patient is NOT allergic to atropine products

### Patient Education on Device Use:

#### HandiHaler Device:
1. Open dust cap of HandiHaler
2. Open mouthpiece
3. Remove capsule from blister immediately before use
4. Place capsule in center chamber
5. Close mouthpiece until you hear a click (leaves dust cap open)
6. Press green button once to pierce capsule
7. Breathe out completely (away from device)
8. Place mouthpiece between lips and breathe in slowly and deeply
9. Hold breath for 10 seconds
10. Breathe out away from device
11. Repeat inhalation to ensure full dose
12. Remove used capsule and dispose

### After Administration:
- ✓ Assess respiratory status 30-60 minutes after first dose
- ✓ Monitor for dry mouth and recommend sugar-free candy/gum
- ✓ Assess for urinary retention, especially in elderly males
- ✓ Document effectiveness and any side effects

### Ongoing Monitoring:
- Respiratory assessment (improvement should be gradual over days/weeks)
- Signs of respiratory infection
- Urinary output (especially in elderly or those with prostatic hyperplasia)
- Vision changes (may indicate glaucoma)
- Oral cavity for signs of candidiasis (less common than with steroids)

## Patient Teaching

### Proper Device Technique:
- **HandiHaler specific:**
  - "These capsules are for INHALATION only - never swallow them"
  - "You should hear the capsule rattle when you breathe in - this means it's working"
  - "If no rattle, the capsule may not be pierced - press green button again"
  - "Always use a new capsule for each dose"
  - "Store capsules in sealed blister until ready to use"

### General Instructions:
- **Purpose:** "This medication keeps your airways open all day to help you breathe easier and prevent COPD flare-ups."
- **Daily use:** "Use this EVERY DAY at the same time, even when you feel well. This is a controller medication, not for quick relief."
- **Not for rescue:** "This does NOT work quickly for sudden shortness of breath. Use your albuterol (rescue inhaler) for that."
- **Same time daily:** "Try to use at the same time each day to maintain steady levels."
- **Don't double dose:** "If you miss a dose, take it as soon as you remember unless it's almost time for the next dose. Never double up."

### Managing Side Effects:
- **Dry mouth:** 
  - Sip water frequently
  - Suck on sugar-free candy or chew sugar-free gum
  - Use artificial saliva products if needed
  - Maintain good oral hygiene
- **Constipation:** Increase fluids and fiber; discuss with doctor if persistent
- **Report immediately:**
  - Difficulty urinating or painful urination
  - Eye pain or vision changes
  - Sudden worsening of breathing
  - Allergic reactions (rash, swelling, difficulty breathing)

### Storage:
- Store at room temperature (59-86°F)
- Keep capsules in sealed blister until ready to use
- Protect from moisture and light
- Never store capsules in HandiHaler device
- Keep out of reach of children

### Safety:
- Do NOT get powder in eyes - may worsen glaucoma
- Rinse mouth after use to prevent dry mouth
- Clean HandiHaler device monthly (see instructions)
- Do not use more than once daily

## Special Considerations for COPD Patients

- **First-line maintenance therapy:** Tiotropium is a cornerstone of COPD management
- **Reduces exacerbations:** Proven to reduce COPD flare-ups and hospitalizations
- **Improves quality of life:** Better symptom control and exercise tolerance
- **Not for acute relief:** Patients must understand this is preventive, not rescue
- **Long-acting means compliance critical:** Missing doses reduces effectiveness
- **May be combined with:** LABA (long-acting beta agonists), inhaled steroids, or SABA for comprehensive COPD management

---

## Clinical Pearls

- **Takes time to work:** Full benefits may not be seen for several days to weeks
- **Once daily dosing:** Improves compliance compared to multiple daily doses
- **Capsule should rattle:** When inhaling, you should hear the capsule vibrating
- **Empty capsule is normal:** After inhalation, capsule should be mostly empty (small powder residue is normal)
- **Device cleaning:** Clean mouthpiece monthly with warm water, let air dry
- **Blister integrity:** Damaged blisters may contain less medication
- **Elderly considerations:** Monitor closely for urinary retention and constipation

---

## Red Flags - Notify Provider Immediately

- ⚠️ Paradoxical bronchospasm (immediate worsening of breathing after use)
- ⚠️ Eye pain, blurred vision, seeing halos around lights (possible glaucoma)
- ⚠️ Difficulty urinating or inability to urinate
- ⚠️ Allergic reaction (rash, swelling of face/tongue/throat, difficulty breathing)
- ⚠️ Rapid or irregular heartbeat
- ⚠️ Severe constipation

## Case Application: Mr. Martinez

**Prescribed:** Tiotropium 18 mcg, 1 capsule inhaled daily via HandiHaler

**Rationale for this patient:**
- First-line long-acting bronchodilator for COPD maintenance
- Provides 24-hour bronchodilation
- Reduces frequency of exacerbations
- Once-daily dosing improves adherence (important given patient's history of non-compliance)

**Nursing considerations specific to Mr. Martinez:**
- **Critical teaching point:** Emphasize this is DAILY medication, not PRN like albuterol
- **Previous non-adherence:** Focus on importance of daily use and provide strategies to remember
- **Link to routine:** Suggest taking at same time daily (e.g., with breakfast or bedtime)
- **Handihaler technique:** Ensure correct technique before discharge (patient demonstrated successfully)
- **Dry mouth:** Patient may already have dry mouth from decreased oral intake; emphasize hydration
- **Male patient considerations:** Monitor for any urinary difficulties

**Expected outcomes for Mr. Martinez:**
- Decreased frequency of dyspnea episodes
- Improved baseline lung function
- Reduced need for rescue inhaler
- Decreased risk of future exacerbations
- Better quality of life and activity tolerance

**Specific teaching completed:**
- ✓ Demonstrated HandiHaler technique correctly
- ✓ Verbalized understanding of daily vs PRN use
- ✓ Identified plan to take with morning coffee to remember
- ✓ Received written instructions with pictures
- ✓ Provided contact information for questions

## Comparison: Tiotropium vs Albuterol

| Feature | Tiotropium (Spiriva) | Albuterol (Proventil) |
|---------|---------------------|---------------------|
| **Type** | Long-acting anticholinergic | Short-acting beta-2 agonist |
| **Use** | Daily maintenance | Quick relief/rescue |
| **Onset** | 30 minutes | 5-15 minutes |
| **Duration** | 24+ hours | 4-6 hours |
| **Frequency** | Once daily | Every 4-6 hours PRN |
| **Purpose in COPD** | Prevent symptoms | Treat acute symptoms |

**Key point for patients:** "Spiriva is like your daily vitamins - you take it every day to stay healthy. Albuterol is like a pain reliever - you use it when you have symptoms."
