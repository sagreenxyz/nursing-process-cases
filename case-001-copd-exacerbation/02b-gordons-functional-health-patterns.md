# Data Analysis Using Gordon's Functional Health Patterns

## Overview

**Gordon's Functional Health Patterns** is a holistic nursing assessment framework developed by Marjory Gordon. It organizes patient data into 11 functional patterns that represent the whole person - not just body systems.

This framework is particularly useful because:
- ✓ It's **person-centered**, not disease-centered
- ✓ It captures **psychosocial** aspects often missed in body systems reviews
- ✓ It aligns with **NANDA-I nursing diagnoses** (many diagnoses map directly to patterns)
- ✓ It helps identify **strengths** as well as problems
- ✓ It considers the patient's **lifestyle, culture, and values**

## The 11 Functional Health Patterns

Let's organize Mr. Martinez's assessment data using Gordon's framework:

---

## Pattern 1: Health Perception - Health Management

**Focus:** How the patient perceives their health and manages their healthcare

### Assessment Data

**Subjective:**
- Has COPD diagnosis, understands he needs daily medications
- States he ran out of inhalers 1 week ago
- Reports "I try to manage but it's hard"
- Acknowledges transportation difficulties getting to pharmacy
- Expresses concern about medication costs
- Has Medicare + supplemental insurance
- States he knows he should have refilled earlier

**Objective:**
- Prescribed COPD medication regimen (multiple inhalers, daily meds)
- No medications at bedside when admitted
- Recent history of recurrent bronchitis (3 episodes in 6 months)
- Current admission for COPD exacerbation + pneumonia
- Admits non-adherence to prescribed regimen

**Pattern Analysis:**

**Dysfunctional Pattern Identified:** ⚠️

**Strengths:**
- Has insight into his health needs
- Acknowledges importance of medications
- Has appropriate insurance coverage
- Seeks care when needed

**Problems:**
- Medication non-adherence due to multiple barriers (not willful neglect)
- Transportation barriers to accessing pharmacy
- Financial concerns despite insurance (copays, gaps)
- Recurrent infections suggest inadequate disease management
- Lives alone with limited support system

**Impact on Current Illness:**
Running out of bronchodilators likely precipitated this exacerbation. Loss of daily LAMA/LABA therapy → increased airway inflammation → increased vulnerability to infection → pneumonia → acute exacerbation.

**Nursing Diagnoses Related to This Pattern:**
- Ineffective Health Management
- Ineffective Health Maintenance
- Noncompliance (though this term is controversial - prefer "nonadherence")
- Risk-Prone Health Behavior

---

## Pattern 2: Nutritional - Metabolic

**Focus:** Food and fluid intake, tissue integrity, wound healing, temperature regulation

### Assessment Data

**Subjective:**
- Reports decreased appetite x 3 days
- States "I haven't felt like eating"
- Fluid intake decreased during illness
- Reports urine is dark yellow
- No nausea or vomiting
- No difficulty swallowing
- Reports unintentional weight loss over past months

**Objective:**
- Temperature: 38.2°C (100.8°F) - **febrile**
- Weight: Lost 5 lbs in past week (acute loss)
- Body habitus: Cachectic appearance
- Skin turgor: Poor (tenting present)
- Mucous membranes: Pale pink, slightly dry
- Oral cavity: No lesions, dentures fit poorly
- Fluid intake: ~400 mL in past 24 hours (inadequate)
- Last void: 6 hours ago, small amount, dark concentrated
- No edema present
- Skin intact, no wounds or pressure injuries

**Laboratory Data:**
- BUN: 24 mg/dL (elevated) - suggests dehydration
- Hemoglobin: 16.2 g/dL (elevated) - hemoconcentration
- Hematocrit: 49% (elevated) - hemoconcentration
- Albumin: 3.2 g/dL (low-normal) - suggests chronic poor nutrition

**Pattern Analysis:**

**Dysfunctional Pattern Identified:** ⚠️

**Acute Issues:**
- **Dehydration** from decreased intake during illness
- Fever increasing fluid losses
- Concentrated urine, elevated BUN/Hct confirm fluid deficit

**Chronic Issues:**
- **Malnutrition** - cachexia common in COPD
- COPD increases metabolic demands
- Dyspnea interferes with eating (too breathless to eat)
- Poor dentition may limit food choices
- Living alone - who prepares meals?

**Temperature Dysregulation:**
- Fever from pneumonia infection
- Increases metabolic rate and fluid needs

**Nursing Diagnoses Related to This Pattern:**
- Deficient Fluid Volume
- Imbalanced Nutrition: Less Than Body Requirements
- Risk for Imbalanced Body Temperature
- Impaired Oral Mucous Membrane (if dehydration worsens)

---

## Pattern 3: Elimination

**Focus:** Bowel, bladder, and skin elimination patterns

### Assessment Data

**Subjective:**
- Last bowel movement: 2 days ago, "normal for me"
- Reports normal bowel pattern usually every 2-3 days
- No constipation, diarrhea, or incontinence
- Last void: 6 hours ago (oliguria concerning)
- Urine described as dark yellow
- No dysuria, urgency, or frequency
- No history of urinary problems

**Objective:**
- Abdomen: Soft, non-tender, bowel sounds present in all quadrants
- No bladder distention
- Urine output: Decreased (oliguria)
- Urine color: Dark, concentrated (observed on admission)
- No incontinence
- Skin intact, no diaphoresis noted (despite fever)

**Pattern Analysis:**

**Mildly Dysfunctional Pattern:** ⚠️

**Bowel Elimination:**
- Currently functional
- Pattern Q 2-3 days may indicate mild constipation
- Risk factors: dehydration, immobility, medications (if opioids prescribed)

**Urinary Elimination:**
- **Oliguria** - concerning sign of dehydration
- Dark, concentrated urine confirms fluid deficit
- Decreased output likely pre-renal (from dehydration, not kidney damage)
- Will improve with hydration

**Nursing Diagnoses Related to This Pattern:**
- Risk for Constipation (dehydration, immobility, possible opioids)
- Impaired Urinary Elimination (oliguria related to fluid deficit)

**Note:** This pattern is less problematic than others but requires monitoring.

## Critical Thinking Exercise

**Compare your analysis:**

1. Look at Document 02 (body systems clustering)
2. Look at this document (Gordon's patterns)
3. **What problems did Gordon's framework reveal that body systems didn't?**

<details>
<summary>Click for answer</summary>

Gordon's patterns identified:
- **Social isolation** - completely missed in body systems review
- **Ineffective coping** - not captured by physiological clustering
- **Role changes and losses** - psychosocial impact not visible
- **Medication adherence barriers** - identified as system problem, not just non-compliance
- **Spiritual concerns** - not addressed in body systems
- **Impact on self-concept** - emotional/psychological dimension
- **Stress overload** - contextual understanding of patient's life

**Key Point:** Body systems identify the "what" (physiological problems). Gordon's patterns identify the "why" and "how" (person in context, barriers, resources, meaning).

</details>

## When to Use Each Framework

### Use Body Systems Clustering When:
- Acute medical crisis requiring rapid physiological assessment
- Medical-surgical focus
- Communicating with physicians (they think in systems)
- Prioritizing physiological problems quickly

### Use Gordon's Functional Health Patterns When:
- Comprehensive nursing assessment
- Chronic disease management
- Discharge planning (identifies barriers)
- Holistic care planning
- Understanding the person's life context
- Identifying psychosocial needs

### Best Practice:
**Use BOTH.** Start with systems in acute crisis, then expand to patterns for comprehensive assessment.

---

## Key Takeaways

✓ **Gordon's patterns capture the whole person** - not just disease states

✓ **Social determinants of health** become visible (isolation, barriers, resources)

✓ **Patterns interact** - anxiety worsens breathing, poor sleep impacts coping

✓ **Strengths are identified** - intact cognition is a major asset for this patient

✓ **Functional patterns help predict discharge needs** - social isolation and barriers will impact home management

✓ **NANDA diagnoses map to patterns** - makes diagnosis formulation easier

✓ **Person-centered, not disease-centered** - sees Mr. Martinez as a person coping with illness, not just "a COPD patient"

---

## Next Steps

You now have **two complementary analyses** of Mr. Martinez:
- **Document 02:** Physiological clustering (body systems)
- **Document 02b:** Holistic clustering (Gordon's patterns)

**→ Continue to Document 03: Formulating Nursing Diagnoses**

You'll learn to write proper NANDA-I nursing diagnostic statements using the evidence from BOTH frameworks.
