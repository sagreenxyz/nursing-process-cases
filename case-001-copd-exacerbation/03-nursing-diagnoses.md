# Nursing Diagnoses: The PES Format

## Overview

You've completed comprehensive assessment and analysis. Now it's time to **identify and write nursing diagnoses** - the problems that nurses can independently diagnose and treat.

**What is a Nursing Diagnosis?**
- A clinical judgment about individual, family, or community responses to actual or potential health problems
- Focuses on patient **responses** to illness, not the disease itself
- Guides nursing interventions and care planning
- Based on NANDA-I (North American Nursing Diagnosis Association-International) taxonomy

**Why Nursing Diagnoses Matter:**
- ✓ Standardized language for communication
- ✓ Legal documentation of nursing scope of practice
- ✓ Guides selection of interventions
- ✓ Measures nursing outcomes
- ✓ Distinguishes nursing's unique contribution to patient care

## Nursing Diagnosis vs Medical Diagnosis

### Key Differences

| Aspect | Medical Diagnosis | Nursing Diagnosis |
|--------|------------------|-------------------|
| **Focus** | Disease, pathology | Patient's response to disease |
| **Who makes it** | Physician | Nurse |
| **Treatment** | Medical interventions (meds, surgery) | Nursing interventions (education, positioning, emotional support) |
| **Duration** | Often unchanging | Changes as patient responds to care |
| **Example** | COPD exacerbation | Impaired Gas Exchange |

### Example for Mr. Martinez:

**Medical Diagnosis:** 
- Acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)
- Community-acquired pneumonia

**Nursing Diagnoses:**
- Impaired Gas Exchange r/t ventilation-perfusion imbalance
- Ineffective Airway Clearance r/t excessive mucus and infection
- Anxiety r/t threat to biological integrity

**Key Point:** The physician treats the COPD and pneumonia with medications. The nurse treats how the patient is **responding** to having COPD and pneumonia.

---

## The PES Format Explained

**PES** stands for:
- **P** = Problem
- **E** = Etiology (cause)
- **S** = Signs & Symptoms (defining characteristics)

### Three-Part Statement: P.E.S.

**Formula:**
```
[Problem] related to [Etiology] as evidenced by [Signs & Symptoms]
```

**Abbreviated:**
```
[Problem] r/t [Etiology] AEB [Signs & Symptoms]
```

---

### P = PROBLEM (The Nursing Diagnosis Label)

**What it is:**
- The NANDA-I approved diagnostic label
- Describes the **patient's response** to a health problem
- Examples: Impaired Gas Exchange, Acute Pain, Anxiety, Risk for Falls

**How to identify it:**
- Look at your clustered assessment data
- What is the patient experiencing?
- What is the patient unable to do?
- What is at risk?

**For Mr. Martinez:**
- He can't adequately exchange oxygen and CO2 → **Impaired Gas Exchange**
- He can't clear his airway effectively → **Ineffective Airway Clearance**
- He's experiencing fear and worry → **Anxiety**

---

### E = ETIOLOGY (Related to...)

**What it is:**
- The **cause** or contributing factors
- What is making the problem occur
- Must be something nursing can address

**Critical Rule:** 
⚠️ The etiology CANNOT be a medical diagnosis or something nurses can't change independently.

**Examples:**

| ❌ INCORRECT | ✓ CORRECT |
|-------------|----------|
| r/t pneumonia | r/t excessive mucus production secondary to infection |
| r/t COPD | r/t ventilation-perfusion imbalance |
| r/t medication | r/t bronchospasm |
| r/t doctor's orders | r/t knowledge deficit |

**Why this matters:**
- If you write "r/t COPD," what can nursing do? Nothing - we can't cure COPD
- If you write "r/t ventilation-perfusion imbalance," nursing CAN intervene: position patient, administer oxygen, clear secretions, teach breathing techniques

**For Mr. Martinez:**
- **Impaired Gas Exchange** r/t ventilation-perfusion imbalance ✓
  - We CAN: Give O2, position, clear airway, monitor
- **Anxiety** r/t threat to biological integrity and dyspnea ✓
  - We CAN: Provide calm presence, teach relaxation, reduce stimuli

---

### S = SIGNS & SYMPTOMS (As Evidenced By...)

**What it is:**
- The **defining characteristics** from your assessment
- Objective data (signs) and subjective data (symptoms)
- PROOF that the problem exists
- Also called "related factors" or "defining characteristics"

**How to write it:**
- Include both subjective ("patient states...") and objective (vital signs, lab values, observations)
- Be specific with numbers/measurements
- Include multiple pieces of evidence

**For Mr. Martinez:**

**Impaired Gas Exchange** AEB:
- SpO2 88% on room air
- ABG: pH 7.33, PaCO2 58 mmHg, PaO2 55 mmHg
- Respiratory rate 28 breaths/min
- Use of accessory muscles
- Restlessness
- Patient statement: "I can't catch my breath"

---

## Types of Nursing Diagnoses

### 1. Actual Diagnoses (Problem-Focused)
**Format:** Problem r/t Etiology AEB Signs & Symptoms

**Definition:** Problems that currently exist; you have assessment data proving they exist

**Example:**
**Impaired Gas Exchange** r/t ventilation-perfusion imbalance AEB SpO2 88%, ABG pH 7.33, PaCO2 58 mmHg, PaO2 55 mmHg, respiratory rate 28, use of accessory muscles, dyspnea

---

### 2. Risk Diagnoses
**Format:** Risk for [Problem] r/t [Risk Factors]

**Definition:** Problems that don't exist yet, but the patient is vulnerable; no AEB because it hasn't happened

**Example:**
**Risk for Falls** r/t severe dyspnea, weakness, hypoxemia, and need to ambulate to bathroom

**Note:** NO "AEB" - the patient hasn't fallen. These are risk factors.

---

### 3. Health Promotion Diagnoses
**Format:** Readiness for Enhanced [Health Behavior]

**Definition:** Patient is doing well but wants to do even better; motivation for improvement

**Example:**
**Readiness for Enhanced Self-Health Management** (if patient was motivated and adherent)

**For Mr. Martinez:** Not applicable currently - he's in acute crisis

---

### 4. Syndrome Diagnoses
**Format:** [Syndrome Name]

**Definition:** A cluster of related diagnoses that occur together

**Example:**
**Frail Elderly Syndrome** - might apply to Mr. Martinez given age, malnutrition, social isolation

---

## Step-by-Step: Writing PES Statements

### Example 1: Impaired Gas Exchange

**STEP 1: Identify the Problem**
- Review respiratory cluster
- Patient has SpO2 88%, respiratory acidosis, hypoxemia, hypercapnia
- Problem = **Impaired Gas Exchange**

**STEP 2: Identify the Etiology**
- WHY does he have impaired gas exchange?
- COPD causes air trapping → ventilation-perfusion mismatch
- Pneumonia → alveolar inflammation → reduced gas diffusion
- Etiology = **ventilation-perfusion imbalance secondary to COPD exacerbation and pneumonia**

**STEP 3: Gather the Evidence (AEB)**
- SpO2: 88% on room air
- ABG: pH 7.33, PaCO2 58 mmHg, PaO2 55 mmHg, HCO3 30 mEq/L
- Respiratory rate: 28 breaths/min
- Nasal flaring, use of accessory muscles
- Restlessness
- Tachycardia (108 bpm) - compensatory
- Patient states "I can't catch my breath"

**COMPLETE STATEMENT:**

**Impaired Gas Exchange** r/t ventilation-perfusion imbalance secondary to COPD exacerbation and pneumonia AEB SpO2 88% on room air, ABG results (pH 7.33, PaCO2 58 mmHg, PaO2 55 mmHg), respiratory rate 28, use of accessory muscles and nasal flaring, tachycardia, restlessness, and patient report of dyspnea.

---

### Example 2: Ineffective Airway Clearance

**STEP 1: Identify the Problem**
- Excessive secretions, productive cough, rhonchi
- Problem = **Ineffective Airway Clearance**

**STEP 2: Identify the Etiology**
- WHY can't he clear airway?
- Infection → increased mucus production
- Dehydration → thick secretions
- Fatigue → weak cough
- Etiology = **excessive mucus production and dehydration secondary to infection**

**STEP 3: Gather the Evidence**
- Productive cough with thick yellow-green sputum
- Rhonchi throughout lung fields
- Diminished breath sounds
- Patient reports difficulty expectorating
- Dehydration (poor skin turgor)
- Weak cough effort due to fatigue
- Adventitious breath sounds (wheezes + crackles)

**COMPLETE STATEMENT:**

**Ineffective Airway Clearance** r/t excessive mucus production and dehydration secondary to respiratory infection AEB productive cough with thick yellow-green sputum (~2 tablespoons/day), rhonchi and crackles on auscultation, diminished breath sounds bilaterally, patient report of difficulty bringing up secretions, poor skin turgor indicating dehydration, and weak cough effort.

---

### Example 3: Anxiety

**STEP 1: Identify the Problem**
- Patient appears anxious, restless
- States "feels like suffocating"
- Problem = **Anxiety**

**STEP 2: Identify the Etiology**
- WHY is he anxious?
- Severe dyspnea → fear of death
- Threat to health
- Etiology = **threat to biological integrity and sensation of dyspnea**

**STEP 3: Gather the Evidence**
- Patient states "I feel like I'm suffocating"
- Restlessness, inability to relax
- Wide-eyed, fearful facial expression
- Tachycardia (may be both hypoxemia AND anxiety)
- Elevated blood pressure
- Difficulty sleeping past 2 nights

**COMPLETE STATEMENT:**

**Anxiety** r/t threat to biological integrity and severe dyspnea AEB patient statement "I feel like I'm suffocating," restlessness, wide-eyed fearful expression, tachycardia (HR 108), elevated BP (152/88), and reported sleep disruption for 2 nights.

---

### Example 4: Deficient Fluid Volume

**STEP 1: Identify the Problem**
- Poor skin turgor, dark urine, decreased intake
- Problem = **Deficient Fluid Volume**

**STEP 2: Identify the Etiology**
- WHY is he dehydrated?
- Decreased oral intake (too dyspneic to drink)
- Increased insensible losses (tachypnea, fever)
- Etiology = **inadequate fluid intake and increased insensible losses**

**STEP 3: Gather the Evidence**
- Decreased oral intake × 3 days
- Poor skin turgor (tenting)
- Dark, concentrated urine
- Small urine output (last void 6 hours ago)
- Elevated BUN (24 mg/dL) with normal creatinine
- Elevated Hgb/Hct (hemoconcentration)
- Dry mucous membranes (though described as pale pink)
- Weight loss (5 lbs in 1 week)

**COMPLETE STATEMENT:**

**Deficient Fluid Volume** r/t inadequate oral intake secondary to dyspnea and increased insensible losses from tachypnea and fever AEB poor skin turgor, dark concentrated urine with decreased output, elevated BUN (24 mg/dL), elevated hemoglobin (16.2) and hematocrit (49%) indicating hemoconcentration, acute weight loss of 5 lbs in 1 week, and patient report of decreased fluid intake × 3 days.

---

### Example 5: Risk for Falls (Risk Diagnosis)

**STEP 1: Identify the Problem**
- Hasn't fallen, but at high risk
- Problem = **Risk for Falls**

**STEP 2: Identify Risk Factors (NOT etiology)**
- Age 68
- Severe dyspnea limiting attention/awareness
- Hypoxemia affecting cognition/balance
- Weakness and fatigue
- Unfamiliar hospital environment
- Need to ambulate to bathroom
- Lives alone (will be issue at discharge)

**COMPLETE STATEMENT (No AEB):**

**Risk for Falls** r/t age, severe dyspnea, hypoxemia, weakness, fatigue, unfamiliar environment, and need to ambulate to bathroom independently.

---

### Example 6: Activity Intolerance

**STEP 1: Identify the Problem**
- Can't perform ADLs without severe dyspnea
- Problem = **Activity Intolerance**

**STEP 2: Identify the Etiology**
- WHY can't he tolerate activity?
- Imbalance between oxygen supply and demand
- Etiology = **imbalance between oxygen supply and demand**

**STEP 3: Gather the Evidence**
- Dyspnea on minimal exertion
- Unable to complete ADLs without assistance
- SpO2 drops with activity
- Reports weakness and fatigue
- Can only speak 3-4 words before needing breath
- Requires assistance with bathing, dressing

**COMPLETE STATEMENT:**

**Activity Intolerance** r/t imbalance between oxygen supply and demand secondary to impaired gas exchange AEB dyspnea on minimal exertion (unable to complete sentences), inability to perform ADLs independently, SpO2 desaturation with activity, weakness and fatigue requiring assistance with bathing and dressing, and patient report of feeling "too tired to do anything."

---

### Example 7: Ineffective Health Management

**STEP 1: Identify the Problem**
- Medication non-adherence led to hospitalization
- Problem = **Ineffective Health Management** (formerly "Ineffective Health Maintenance")

**STEP 2: Identify the Etiology**
- WHY isn't he managing his health effectively?
- Insufficient resources (transportation, finances)
- Lack of social support
- Knowledge may have gaps too
- Etiology = **insufficient resources and inadequate support systems**

**STEP 3: Gather the Evidence**
- Ran out of medications 1 week ago
- No transportation to pharmacy
- Lives alone, children out of state
- Expresses concern about medication costs
- This exacerbation could have been prevented with adherence
- History of similar issues

**COMPLETE STATEMENT:**

**Ineffective Health Management** r/t insufficient resources (transportation, finances), inadequate support systems, and social isolation AEB medication non-adherence (ran out 1 week ago), lack of transportation to obtain medications, patient living alone with family out of state, expressed concerns about medication costs, and preventable hospitalization for COPD exacerbation.

---

## Mr. Martinez: Complete Nursing Diagnosis List

### Priority 1: LIFE-THREATENING (Immediate Intervention Required)

**1. Impaired Gas Exchange** r/t ventilation-perfusion imbalance secondary to COPD exacerbation and pneumonia AEB SpO2 88% on room air, ABG results (pH 7.33, PaCO2 58 mmHg, PaO2 55 mmHg), respiratory rate 28, use of accessory muscles and nasal flaring, tachycardia (HR 108), restlessness, and patient report of dyspnea.

**Rationale:** Respiratory failure is immediately life-threatening. Hypoxemia and respiratory acidosis can lead to cardiac arrest, organ failure, and death.

---

**2. Ineffective Airway Clearance** r/t excessive mucus production and dehydration secondary to respiratory infection AEB productive cough with thick yellow-green sputum, rhonchi and crackles on auscultation, diminished breath sounds bilaterally, patient report of difficulty expectorating, poor skin turgor, and weak cough effort.

**Rationale:** Mucus plugging worsens gas exchange and can lead to further respiratory compromise. Must clear airway for oxygen to reach alveoli.

---

**3. Ineffective Breathing Pattern** r/t fatigue, dyspnea, and airway obstruction AEB respiratory rate 28 (tachypnea), use of accessory muscles, pursed-lip breathing, inability to speak in complete sentences (3-4 words only), orthopnea (tripod position), and patient statement "I can't catch my breath."

**Rationale:** Current breathing pattern is not sustainable. Patient will fatigue, leading to respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation if not corrected.

---

### Priority 2: SEVERE (Require Prompt Intervention)

**4. Deficient Fluid Volume** r/t inadequate oral intake secondary to dyspnea and increased insensible losses from tachypnea and fever AEB poor skin turgor, dark concentrated urine with decreased output, elevated BUN (24 mg/dL), elevated hemoglobin (16.2) and hematocrit (49%), acute weight loss of 5 lbs in 1 week, and patient report of decreased fluid intake × 3 days.

**Rationale:** Dehydration thickens secretions (worsening airway clearance) and reduces cardiac output. Relatively easy to correct with IV fluids and will improve other problems.

---

**5. Anxiety** r/t threat to biological integrity and severe dyspnea AEB patient statement "I feel like I'm suffocating," restlessness, wide-eyed fearful expression, tachycardia (HR 108), elevated BP (152/88), and reported sleep disruption for 2 nights.

**Rationale:** Anxiety increases oxygen demand and worsens dyspnea, creating a vicious cycle. Untreated anxiety makes respiratory distress worse. Must break the anxiety-dyspnea cycle.

---

### Priority 3: MODERATE (Important but Less Urgent)

**6. Activity Intolerance** r/t imbalance between oxygen supply and demand secondary to impaired gas exchange AEB dyspnea on minimal exertion, inability to perform ADLs independently, SpO2 desaturation with activity, weakness and fatigue requiring assistance with bathing and dressing, and patient report of feeling exhausted.

**Rationale:** Limits independence and quality of life. Important for rehabilitation but not immediately life-threatening. Will improve as gas exchange improves.

---

**7. Self-Care Deficit (bathing, dressing)** r/t severe dyspnea and fatigue AEB inability to complete bathing and dressing without assistance, SpO2 drops during ADL activities, requires frequent rest periods, and demonstrates need for help with hygiene tasks.

**Rationale:** Patient cannot meet basic needs independently during acute illness. Safety concern (falls) if attempts ADLs alone. Will require phased approach to independence.

---

**8. Imbalanced Nutrition: Less Than Body Requirements** r/t dyspnea interfering with eating and increased metabolic demands AEB cachectic appearance, decreased appetite × 3 days, unintentional weight loss, low body mass, and patient report of difficulty eating while short of breath.

**Rationale:** Chronic malnutrition in COPD is common. Impacts muscle strength (including respiratory muscles), immune function, and healing. Must be addressed but less urgent than oxygenation.

---

### Priority 4: RISK DIAGNOSES (Potential Problems)

**9. Risk for Falls** r/t age (68 years), severe dyspnea, hypoxemia affecting cognition, weakness and fatigue, unfamiliar hospital environment, need to ambulate to bathroom, and orthostatic changes from dehydration.

**Rationale:** Multiple fall risk factors present. Falls could cause injury delaying recovery or causing additional complications. Prevention is key.

---

**10. Risk for Impaired Skin Integrity** r/t impaired oxygenation, immobility, dehydration, malnutrition, and age-related skin changes.

**Rationale:** Poor oxygenation and nutrition combined with bed rest increase pressure injury risk. Prevention easier than treatment.

---

**11. Risk for Infection (progression)** r/t compromised immune response from malnutrition and chronic disease, current pneumonia, and invasive procedures (IV line).

**Rationale:** Already has pneumonia. Risk for sepsis, hospital-acquired infections, or worsening of current infection. Vigilant monitoring needed.

---

### Priority 5: LONG-TERM/DISCHARGE PLANNING

**12. Ineffective Health Management** r/t insufficient resources (transportation, finances), inadequate support systems, and social isolation AEB medication non-adherence (ran out 1 week ago), lack of transportation to obtain medications, patient living alone with family out of state, expressed concerns about medication costs, and preventable hospitalization.

**Rationale:** This is the root cause of current crisis. Must be addressed or patient will return to hospital. Requires case management, social work, community resources.

---

**13. Social Isolation** r/t chronic illness, limited mobility, lack of transportation, and geographic separation from family AEB lives alone, children out of state, reports difficulty getting out, no visitors, and inability to participate in previously enjoyed activities.

**Rationale:** Impacts mental health, medication adherence, safety. May not seek help when needed. Affects quality of life and potentially outcomes.

---

**14. Deficient Knowledge** r/t insufficient information about COPD self-management, medication regimen, and symptom recognition AEB medication non-adherence, failure to seek medical attention earlier in exacerbation, questions about inhaler use, and preventable hospitalization.

**Rationale:** While he has COPD, gaps in knowledge about when to seek help, proper inhaler technique, and self-management contributed to crisis. Education essential for discharge.

---

## Collaborative Problems

**What are Collaborative Problems?**
- Problems that require **both** nursing AND medical interventions
- Nurses cannot treat independently
- Written as "Potential Complication" (PC) or "Risk for Complications" (RC)
- Not NANDA-I diagnoses

### Mr. Martinez's Collaborative Problems:

**PC: Respiratory Failure**
- Requires medical interventions: oxygen orders, medication orders
- Requires nursing monitoring: vital signs, SpO2, respiratory status, ABGs
- Nurse cannot order oxygen level changes independently (usually)

**PC: Sepsis secondary to pneumonia**
- Requires medical treatment: antibiotics
- Requires nursing monitoring: vital signs, labs, clinical status

**PC: Cardiac complications (cor pulmonale exacerbation, dysrhythmias)**
- Requires medical treatment: medications, diagnostics
- Requires nursing monitoring: telemetry, vital signs, cardiac assessment

**PC: Electrolyte imbalances**
- Requires medical treatment: IV fluids, replacements
- Requires nursing monitoring: labs, assessment, I&O

---

## Priority Setting: The Rationale

### Why This Order?

**Ask yourself:**

1. **What will kill the patient fastest if not treated?**
   - Impaired Gas Exchange (minutes to hours)
   - Airway obstruction (minutes)
   - Breathing pattern failure (hours)

2. **What is making other problems worse?**
   - Hypoxemia affects everything
   - Anxiety worsens dyspnea
   - Dehydration thickens secretions

3. **What has the potential to improve multiple problems?**
   - Treating gas exchange → improves anxiety, activity tolerance, cognition
   - Treating dehydration → improves secretion clearance, cardiac output
   - Breaking anxiety cycle → reduces oxygen demand

4. **What's the relationship between problems?**
   ```
   Impaired Gas Exchange (treat first)
           ↓
   Reduces hypoxemia
           ↓
   Improves: Activity Intolerance
             Anxiety  
             Cognitive function (fall risk)
             Cardiac workload
   ```

5. **What can wait until the patient is stable?**
   - Education (can't learn when hypoxemic and anxious)
   - Long-term planning
   - Psychosocial issues

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### ❌ Mistake #1: Using Medical Diagnoses as the Problem

**WRONG:** COPD r/t smoking history AEB dyspnea
- COPD is a medical diagnosis, not a nursing diagnosis
- Nurses don't diagnose COPD

**RIGHT:** Impaired Gas Exchange r/t ventilation-perfusion imbalance secondary to COPD AEB SpO2 88%...

---

### ❌ Mistake #2: Using Medical Diagnoses in the Etiology

**WRONG:** Anxiety r/t pneumonia
- Nurses don't treat pneumonia (medical problem)
- This implies we should cure the pneumonia to relieve anxiety

**RIGHT:** Anxiety r/t threat to biological integrity and severe dyspnea
- Nurses CAN treat threat perception and dyspnea effects

---

### ❌ Mistake #3: Circular Reasoning

**WRONG:** Anxiety r/t feeling anxious AEB anxiety
- This says nothing useful
- Doesn't guide interventions

**RIGHT:** Anxiety r/t threat to biological integrity and severe dyspnea AEB restlessness, patient statement "I feel like I'm suffocating"

---

### ❌ Mistake #4: Not Specific Enough

**WRONG:** Ineffective Gas Exchange r/t breathing problems AEB respiratory issues
- Too vague
- Doesn't guide specific interventions

**RIGHT:** Impaired Gas Exchange r/t ventilation-perfusion imbalance secondary to COPD exacerbation and pneumonia AEB SpO2 88%, pH 7.33, PaCO2 58...

---

### ❌ Mistake #5: Writing One Problem Multiple Ways

**WRONG:** 
- Impaired Gas Exchange
- Ineffective Tissue Perfusion
- Activity Intolerance
(All from the same hypoxemia - overlapping)

**RIGHT:** Identify the PRIMARY problem (Impaired Gas Exchange), then the SECONDARY problem (Activity Intolerance is a result of poor gas exchange)

---

### ❌ Mistake #6: Too Many Diagnoses

**WRONG:** Writing 20+ diagnoses
- Unrealistic to address all
- Loses focus on priorities

**RIGHT:** 5-8 priority diagnoses that can realistically be addressed during hospitalization

---

### ❌ Mistake #7: Including the Intervention in the Statement

**WRONG:** Impaired Gas Exchange r/t not receiving enough oxygen
- This implies the solution (give oxygen)
- Etiology should be underlying cause, not lack of treatment

**RIGHT:** Impaired Gas Exchange r/t ventilation-perfusion imbalance

---

### ❌ Mistake #8: Using Judgmental Language

**WRONG:** Ineffective Health Management r/t patient non-compliance and laziness
- Judgmental
- Doesn't reflect barriers

**RIGHT:** Ineffective Health Management r/t insufficient resources and inadequate support systems

---

### ❌ Mistake #9: Combining Unrelated Problems

**WRONG:** Anxiety and Pain r/t hospitalization
- These are separate problems requiring different interventions

**RIGHT:** Write separate diagnoses:
- Anxiety r/t threat to health status...
- Acute Pain r/t...

---

### ❌ Mistake #10: Forgetting Risk Diagnoses

**WRONG:** Only writing actual problems that already exist

**RIGHT:** Include risk diagnoses for prevention:
- Risk for Falls
- Risk for Impaired Skin Integrity
- Risk for Infection

---

## Documentation Tips

### In the Medical Record:

**Format:**
```
Priority Nursing Diagnoses:

1. Impaired Gas Exchange r/t ventilation-perfusion imbalance secondary 
   to COPD exacerbation and pneumonia AEB SpO2 88% on room air, ABG 
   results (pH 7.33, PaCO2 58 mmHg, PaO2 55 mmHg), respiratory rate 28, 
   use of accessory muscles and nasal flaring, tachycardia (HR 108), 
   restlessness, and patient report of dyspnea.

2. Ineffective Airway Clearance r/t excessive mucus production and 
   dehydration secondary to respiratory infection AEB productive cough 
   with thick yellow-green sputum, rhonchi and crackles on auscultation...

[Continue with remaining diagnoses]
```

**Update daily** as patient's condition changes:
- Resolve diagnoses when problem no longer exists
- Add new diagnoses as new problems emerge
- Revise etiology or evidence as situation evolves

## Critical Thinking Practice

### Scenario 1: What's Wrong With This Statement?

**"Pneumonia r/t infection AEB fever, productive cough, and infiltrate on chest X-ray"**

<details>
<summary>Click for answer</summary>

**Problems:**
1. Pneumonia is a medical diagnosis, not a nursing diagnosis
2. Nurses don't diagnose pneumonia - physicians do
3. This doesn't guide nursing interventions

**Better Option:**
- Ineffective Airway Clearance r/t excessive mucus production secondary to respiratory infection AEB productive cough, rhonchi...
- Hyperthermia r/t infectious process AEB temperature 38.2°C...

</details>

---

### Scenario 2: Which Etiology is Better?

**A.** Anxiety r/t being in the hospital

**B.** Anxiety r/t threat to biological integrity and severe dyspnea

<details>
<summary>Click for answer</summary>

**B is better**

**Why:**
- More specific about the threat
- "Being in the hospital" is vague - doesn't guide interventions
- "Threat to biological integrity and severe dyspnea" tells us WHAT to address:
  - Reduce the threat (treat the respiratory problem)
  - Manage the dyspnea
  - Help patient feel safer

</details>

---

### Scenario 3: Prioritize These

Given these three diagnoses, which order would you prioritize?

- Activity Intolerance r/t imbalance between O2 supply and demand
- Impaired Gas Exchange r/t ventilation-perfusion imbalance  
- Deficient Knowledge r/t COPD self-management

<details>
<summary>Click for answer</summary>

**Correct Priority Order:**

1. **Impaired Gas Exchange** - Life-threatening; patient needs oxygen NOW
2. **Activity Intolerance** - Affects safety and function; secondary to #1
3. **Deficient Knowledge** - Important for discharge but patient can't learn while hypoxemic

**Rationale:**
- ABCs first (gas exchange = breathing)
- Can't work on activity or learning while patient is in respiratory failure
- Knowledge can wait until patient is stable

</details>

---

### Scenario 4: Actual or Risk?

Should this be an actual diagnosis or risk diagnosis?

"The patient is dehydrated with poor skin turgor, elevated BUN, dark urine, and patient reports decreased fluid intake."

<details>
<summary>Click for answer</summary>

**ACTUAL diagnosis**

**Deficient Fluid Volume** r/t inadequate oral intake and increased insensible losses AEB poor skin turgor, elevated BUN, dark concentrated urine, and patient report of decreased intake × 3 days.

**Why:**
- We have EVIDENCE the problem exists (poor skin turgor, elevated BUN, etc.)
- Risk diagnoses are for problems that MIGHT occur but haven't yet
- This patient IS dehydrated NOW

</details>

---

### Scenario 5: Multiple Problems or One?

The patient has:
- Can't bathe self due to dyspnea
- Can't dress self due to dyspnea
- Can't walk to bathroom without stopping
- Can't prepare meals

Is this multiple diagnoses or one?

<details>
<summary>Click for answer</summary>

**Could be written as ONE or TWO diagnoses:**

**Option 1 - Combine related issues:**
**Activity Intolerance** r/t imbalance between oxygen supply and demand AEB inability to complete ADLs (bathing, dressing, ambulation, meal preparation) without severe dyspnea and requiring frequent rest periods.

**Option 2 - Separate by type:**
- **Self-Care Deficit (bathing, dressing)** r/t severe dyspnea and fatigue
- **Activity Intolerance** r/t imbalance between oxygen supply and demand

**Rationale:** 
- All stem from the same cause (poor gas exchange)
- Interventions will be similar (energy conservation, oxygen, pacing)
- More efficient to combine unless you need separate goals for each ADL

</details>

## Next Steps

You now have a complete list of prioritized nursing diagnoses for Mr. Martinez using the PES format. These diagnoses are based on comprehensive assessment data from multiple frameworks.

**→ Continue to Document 04: Care Planning (Goals & Outcomes)**

Next, you'll learn to:
- Write measurable goals for each diagnosis
- Develop expected outcomes
- Create realistic time frames
- Ensure goals are patient-centered and achievable

Each nursing diagnosis will become a care plan with specific goals, interventions, and evaluation criteria.

---

## Key Takeaways

✓ **PES = Problem + Etiology + Signs/Symptoms**

✓ **Nursing diagnoses focus on patient RESPONSES, not diseases**

✓ **Etiology must be something nurses can treat**

✓ **Evidence must be specific and measurable**

✓ **Priority = Life-threatening first (ABCs)**

✓ **Risk diagnoses prevent future problems**

✓ **Update diagnoses as patient condition changes**

✓ **One root cause may lead to multiple diagnoses**

✓ **Quality over quantity - focus on priority problems**

✓ **Diagnoses guide your care plan and interventions**

---

**Remember:** Nursing diagnoses are not just paperwork - they represent your professional judgment about what this patient needs from NURSING. They distinguish your unique contribution to patient care and guide everything you do next.
