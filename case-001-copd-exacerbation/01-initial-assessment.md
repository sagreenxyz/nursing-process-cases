# Initial Assessment: Where to Start

## Overview

When a patient presents in respiratory distress, the assessment must be **systematic, rapid, and prioritized**. You don't have time for a leisurely head-to-toe assessment when someone can't breathe. This guide walks you through the critical first steps of assessment for Mr. Martinez.

---

## Step 1: Recognize the Emergency (First 5 Seconds)

**What You See:**
- Patient in obvious distress
- Tripod position (leaning forward, hands on knees)
- Using accessory muscles to breathe
- Speaking in short, choppy sentences
- Anxious, restless appearance

**What You Think:**
- **"This is a respiratory emergency"**
- **"Airway, Breathing, Circulation - in that order"**
- **"I need to act NOW, then gather more details"**

---

## Step 2: Primary Survey - ABCs (First 30-60 Seconds)

### A - Airway
**Assess:**
- Is the airway open and patent?
- Can the patient speak?
- Are there any obstructions?

**Mr. Martinez:**
- ✓ Airway is patent
- ✓ Speaking (though only 3-4 words at a time due to dyspnea)
- ✓ No stridor, no choking, no foreign body

**Action:** Airway is compromised by disease process, not obstruction. Move to breathing.

---

### B - Breathing
**Assess (look, listen, feel):**
- **Look:** Respiratory rate, depth, rhythm, effort
- **Listen:** Breath sounds, wheezing, stridor
- **Feel:** Chest rise, use of accessory muscles

**Mr. Martinez - Critical Findings:**
- **Respiratory Rate:** 28 breaths/min (normal: 12-20) ⚠️
- **Effort:** Labored, using accessory muscles (sternocleidomastoid, scalenes)
- **Pattern:** Prolonged expiratory phase (classic COPD)
- **Position:** Tripod position (compensatory)
- **Speech:** 3-4 word sentences (can't complete full sentences)
- **Sounds:** Audible expiratory wheezes
- **Skin color:** EMS reported cyanosis (blue lips/nail beds)
- **Oxygen Saturation:** 88% on room air ⚠️⚠️⚠️ **CRITICAL**

**Action Needed:** IMMEDIATE oxygen therapy required!

---

### C - Circulation
**Assess:**
- Heart rate and rhythm
- Blood pressure
- Skin color, temperature, moisture
- Capillary refill
- Peripheral pulses

**Mr. Martinez:**
- **Heart Rate:** 108 bpm (tachycardia - compensating for hypoxia)
- **Blood Pressure:** 152/88 mmHg (elevated - stress response)
- **Skin:** Warm, dry
- **Capillary Refill:** <3 seconds (adequate perfusion)
- **Pulses:** 2+ bilaterally

**Interpretation:** Circulation adequate but compensating. Tachycardia and hypertension are the body's response to hypoxemia and anxiety.

---

### D - Disability (Neurological)
**Assess:**
- Level of consciousness (AVPU or Glasgow Coma Scale)
- Orientation (person, place, time, situation)
- Pupils

**Mr. Martinez:**
- **LOC:** Alert
- **Orientation:** Person, place, time, situation (A&O x4)
- **Pupils:** PERRLA (equal, round, reactive to light and accommodation)
- **Mental Status:** Anxious, restless (appropriate for situation)

**Interpretation:** No neurological impairment. Anxiety is appropriate response to respiratory distress.

---

### E - Exposure
**Quick scan for:**
- Trauma
- Rashes
- Obvious abnormalities

**Mr. Martinez:**
- No trauma
- Barrel chest (chronic COPD finding)
- Appears cachectic (thin, muscle wasting)
- Clubbing of fingernails (chronic hypoxia)

---

## Step 3: Get VITAL Signs (Within First 2-3 Minutes)

**Full Set of Vitals:**
- **Temperature:** 38.2°C (100.8°F) - **FEVER** suggests infection
- **Heart Rate:** 108 bpm
- **Respiratory Rate:** 28/min
- **Blood Pressure:** 152/88 mmHg
- **Oxygen Saturation:** 88% on room air **← Most critical value**
- **Pain:** 2/10 (chest tightness, not true pain)

---

## Step 4: Quick Focused History - SAMPLE Format

While someone is applying oxygen and getting vitals, quickly gather essential history:

### **S** - Signs & Symptoms
- "I can't catch my breath"
- Productive cough with thick, yellow-green sputum x 3 days
- Progressive worsening of dyspnea
- Feeling like "suffocating"

### **A** - Allergies
- **Penicillin** (reports rash) ← **CRITICAL FOR ANTIBIOTIC SELECTION**

### **M** - Medications
- **Home medications:**
  - Albuterol inhaler (rescue) - PRN
  - Tiotropium/Spiriva (long-acting bronchodilator) - daily
  - Lisinopril (blood pressure) - daily
  - Omeprazole (GERD) - daily
- **KEY FINDING:** Ran out of inhalers 1 week ago, hasn't refilled ⚠️

### **P** - Past Medical History
- COPD (diagnosed 8 years ago)
- Hypertension
- GERD
- Recurrent bronchitis
- Former smoker (quit 2 years ago, 45 pack-years)

### **L** - Last Oral Intake
- Decreased appetite and fluid intake x 3 days
- Last void 6 hours ago (small amount)

### **E** - Events Leading to Present Illness
- Symptoms began 3 days ago
- Started with productive cough
- Progressive dyspnea
- Sleeping in recliner x 2 nights (can't lie flat)
- This morning: couldn't walk from bedroom to bathroom without severe SOB
- Called 911

## Step 5: Initial Interventions (While Continuing Assessment)

**Based on assessment so far, IMMEDIATE actions:**

1. ✓ **Apply supplemental oxygen**
   - Start with 2L nasal cannula
   - Goal: SpO2 92-94% (NOT 100% - controlled oxygen in COPD)

2. ✓ **Place on continuous monitoring**
   - Pulse oximetry
   - Cardiac monitor

3. ✓ **Position for comfort**
   - Head of bed elevated 60-90 degrees
   - Allow tripod position if preferred

4. ✓ **Establish IV access**
   - For medications and fluids

5. ✓ **Stay calm and reassuring**
   - Anxiety worsens dyspnea
   - "We're giving you oxygen now. You should start feeling better soon."

---

## Step 6: Focused Respiratory Assessment

**Now that patient is stabilizing with oxygen, do detailed respiratory exam:**

### Inspection:
- ✓ Respiratory rate, depth, rhythm
- ✓ Use of accessory muscles
- ✓ Pursed-lip breathing (patient doing intermittently)
- ✓ Barrel chest (increased AP diameter)
- ✓ Clubbing of fingers

### Palpation:
- ✓ Chest expansion (may be limited)
- ✓ Tactile fremitus (may be decreased)

### Percussion:
- Expected: Hyperresonance (air trapping in COPD)

### Auscultation - **CRITICAL SKILL**:
- ✓ **Bilateral diminished breath sounds** (air trapping)
- ✓ **Expiratory wheezes throughout all lung fields** (bronchospasm)
- ✓ **Coarse crackles in bilateral bases** (secretions, possible pneumonia)
- ✓ **Prolonged expiratory phase** (COPD characteristic)

---

## Step 7: Systems Assessment (Brief but Complete)

### Cardiovascular:
- Heart sounds: S1, S2 present, regular rhythm, no murmurs
- Slight jugular venous distention at 30 degrees
- No peripheral edema
- Strong peripheral pulses

### Neurological:
- Alert, oriented, anxious (appropriate)
- No confusion (important - rules out severe hypercapnia)

### Integumentary:
- Skin warm, dry
- Poor skin turgor (tenting) - suggests dehydration
- Mucous membranes pale pink
- Clubbing of nails (chronic finding)

### Gastrointestinal:
- Abdomen soft, non-tender
- Decreased appetite x 3 days

### Genitourinary:
- Last void 6 hours ago
- Urine described as dark yellow (concentrated - dehydration)

### Musculoskeletal:
- Decreased muscle mass (cachexia)
- Limited mobility due to dyspnea

---

## Critical Thinking: What Does This Assessment Tell You?

### Red Flags Identified:
1. ⚠️ **SpO2 88%** - Severe hypoxemia
2. ⚠️ **RR 28/min** - Tachypnea
3. ⚠️ **Fever 38.2°C** - Suggests infection
4. ⚠️ **Yellow-green sputum** - Suggests bacterial infection
5. ⚠️ **Crackles in bases** - Suggests pneumonia
6. ⚠️ **Medication non-adherence** - Ran out of inhalers 1 week ago
7. ⚠️ **Dehydration signs** - Poor skin turgor, dark urine, decreased oral intake

### Suspected Problem:
**COPD exacerbation triggered by pneumonia, complicated by medication non-adherence and dehydration**

---

## What Labs/Diagnostics Are Needed?

Based on your assessment, you anticipate these orders:

### Labs:
- **CBC** - Check WBC (infection?)
- **BMP** - Check electrolytes, kidney function, hydration status
- **ABG** - Assess oxygenation and acid-base status (critical in respiratory failure)
- **Sputum culture** - Identify organism causing infection

### Imaging:
- **Chest X-ray** - Confirm pneumonia, rule out pneumothorax, assess hyperinflation

### Monitoring:
- **ECG** - Baseline (COPD patients at risk for cardiac complications)

## Student Practice Questions

After reviewing Mr. Martinez's initial assessment, consider:

1. **Why is SpO2 88% more concerning than his respiratory rate of 28?**
   
2. **Why do we target SpO2 92-94% in COPD patients instead of 98-100%?**

3. **What assessment findings specifically suggest pneumonia rather than just COPD exacerbation?**

4. **How does medication non-adherence relate to this current exacerbation?**

5. **What assessment findings indicate dehydration? Why is this concerning?**

6. **Why is the patient in tripod position? What does this tell you about respiratory mechanics?**

7. **The patient has tachycardia and hypertension. Are these primary problems or compensatory responses?**

---

## Key Takeaways

✓ **Prioritize ABCs** - Don't delay oxygen for complete history  
✓ **Act while assessing** - Start interventions as you gather data  
✓ **Look for patterns** - Multiple findings point to COPD exacerbation + pneumonia  
✓ **Consider the whole picture** - Medication non-adherence, social factors matter  
✓ **SpO2 is your friend** - Guides oxygen therapy and tracks improvement  
✓ **COPD patients are different** - Controlled oxygen therapy essential
