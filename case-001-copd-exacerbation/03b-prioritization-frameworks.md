# Prioritization Frameworks for Nursing Care

## Overview

**Prioritization** is one of the most critical nursing skills. You will always have multiple patient needs competing for your attention. How do you decide what to do first?

**Why Prioritization Matters:**
- 🚨 Prevents patient harm by addressing life threats first
- ⏱️ Manages time efficiently in high-demand environments
- 📋 Organizes care systematically rather than randomly
- 🎯 Ensures critical needs aren't overlooked
- 🧠 Demonstrates clinical judgment and critical thinking
- 📊 Required skill for NCLEX and clinical practice

**Key Principle:**
> **"What will kill my patient first if I don't address it?"**

---

## Framework #1: ABCs (Airway, Breathing, Circulation)

### The Foundation of Prioritization

**Remember:** You can survive:
- ~3 minutes without oxygen
- ~3 days without water
- ~3 weeks without food

**Priority Order:**

### A = AIRWAY
**Is the airway open and patent?**

**Critical Questions:**
- Can air get in and out?
- Is there obstruction?
- Is the patient choking?
- Can they maintain their own airway?

**Life-Threatening Airway Problems:**
- Complete airway obstruction (choking)
- Severe swelling (anaphylaxis, angioedema)
- Blood/vomit in airway
- Loss of gag reflex with risk of aspiration
- Severe burns to airway

**Example - Mr. Martinez:**
✓ Airway is PATENT (he can speak, though limited)
- No obstruction
- Can cough (though weak)
- Gag reflex intact
→ Move to B (Breathing)

---

### B = BREATHING
**Is the patient breathing adequately?**

**Critical Questions:**
- Is respiratory rate adequate? (Too fast? Too slow? Absent?)
- Is oxygenation adequate? (SpO2, color, mental status)
- Is breathing effective? (Depth, effort, accessory muscles)
- Is CO2 being eliminated? (ABG, mental status)

**Life-Threatening Breathing Problems:**
- Respiratory arrest
- Severe respiratory distress (impending failure)
- SpO2 < 90%
- Respiratory acidosis
- Pneumothorax
- Severe asthma/COPD exacerbation
- Pulmonary embolism

**Example - Mr. Martinez:**
⚠️ Breathing is IMPAIRED
- SpO2 88% (critical)
- Respiratory rate 28 (tachypnea)
- Respiratory acidosis (pH 7.33, CO2 58)
- Severe dyspnea
- Accessory muscles
→ **THIS IS THE PRIORITY** - Address before moving to C

---

### C = CIRCULATION
**Is perfusion adequate to maintain life?**

**Critical Questions:**
- Is there a pulse? (Adequate rate and quality)
- Is blood pressure adequate?
- Is there active bleeding?
- Are tissues being perfused? (Cap refill, skin color, urine output, LOC)
- Is the heart rhythm stable?

**Life-Threatening Circulation Problems:**
- Cardiac arrest
- Severe bleeding/hemorrhage
- Shock (cardiogenic, hypovolemic, septic, anaphylactic)
- Life-threatening dysrhythmias
- Severe hypotension
- Acute MI

**Example - Mr. Martinez:**
✓ Circulation is COMPENSATING
- HR 108 (tachycardia but adequate)
- BP 152/88 (elevated but perfusing)
- Pulses 2+ bilaterally
- Cap refill < 3 seconds
- Alert and oriented
→ Circulation adequate FOR NOW (but monitor - tachycardia is compensatory)

---

### ABCs Applied: Mr. Martinez Priority Order

1. **BREATHING (Impaired Gas Exchange)** ← Address FIRST
   - SpO2 88%, respiratory acidosis, severe dyspnea
   - Could progress to respiratory arrest

2. **BREATHING (Airway Clearance)** ← Address SECOND
   - Excessive secretions impairing gas exchange
   - Could cause further respiratory compromise

3. **BREATHING (Breathing Pattern)** ← Address THIRD
   - Unsustainable respiratory effort
   - Patient will fatigue

4. **CIRCULATION** ← Monitor closely
   - Currently compensating
   - Could decompensate if breathing doesn't improve

---

## Framework #2: Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs

### The Human Needs Pyramid

```
                    SELF-
                 ACTUALIZATION
                (Achieving potential)
                       
                     ESTEEM
              (Confidence, respect)
                       
               LOVE & BELONGING
            (Relationships, connection)
                       
              SAFETY & SECURITY
         (Health, resources, stability)
                       
              PHYSIOLOGICAL
        (Air, water, food, shelter)
```

**Priority Rule:** Start at the BOTTOM (physiological) and work UP

---

### Level 1: PHYSIOLOGICAL NEEDS (Highest Priority)

**Basic survival needs - address FIRST**

**In Order of Urgency:**
1. **Oxygen** (minutes without = death)
2. **Circulation/Perfusion** (minutes to hours)
3. **Water/Fluid** (days without = death)
4. **Food/Nutrition** (weeks without = death)
5. **Elimination** (comfort, but less urgent)
6. **Temperature regulation** (hypothermia/hyperthermia)
7. **Rest/Sleep** (affects healing)

**Example - Mr. Martinez:**
- Oxygen ✗ (SpO2 88% - CRITICAL)
- Circulation ~ (compensating)
- Hydration ✗ (dehydrated)
- Nutrition ✗ (malnourished, but chronic)
- Elimination ✓ (continent, adequate)
- Temperature ✗ (fever - infection)
- Sleep ✗ (disrupted, but not immediately dangerous)

**Priority:** Oxygen first, then hydration, then others

---

### Level 2: SAFETY & SECURITY

**Address AFTER physiological needs are met**

**Includes:**
- Freedom from physical harm (falls, injuries)
- Freedom from infection
- Pain management
- Medication safety
- Environmental safety

**Example - Mr. Martinez:**
- Risk for Falls (high risk)
- Infection present (pneumonia - being treated)
- Pain (minimal - 2/10)

**Priority:** Prevent falls while treating respiratory issue

---

### Level 3: LOVE & BELONGING

**Address AFTER safety needs are met**

**Includes:**
- Social support
- Family involvement
- Communication with loved ones
- Feeling connected

**Example - Mr. Martinez:**
- Lives alone, children out of state
- Social isolation

**Priority:** Important for discharge planning, but NOT while he's in respiratory failure

---

### Level 4: ESTEEM

**Address AFTER belonging needs are met**

**Includes:**
- Independence
- Dignity
- Self-care abilities
- Control over care

**Example - Mr. Martinez:**
- Self-care deficits
- Loss of independence

**Priority:** Work toward this during recovery phase

---

### Level 5: SELF-ACTUALIZATION

**Address LAST**

**Includes:**
- Personal growth
- Achieving potential
- Meaningful activities
- Quality of life goals

**Example - Mr. Martinez:**
- Ability to attend church
- Maintain hobbies
- Connect with grandchildren

**Priority:** Long-term goals after acute crisis resolved

---

## Framework #3: Urgent vs Important Matrix

### Eisenhower Decision Matrix

|  | **URGENT** | **NOT URGENT** |
|---|---|---|
| **IMPORTANT** | **QUADRANT 1**: DO FIRST<br/>Crises, life threats<br/>*Example: SpO2 88%* | **QUADRANT 2**: SCHEDULE<br/>Prevention, planning<br/>*Example: Discharge planning* |
| **NOT IMPORTANT** | **QUADRANT 3**: DELEGATE<br/>Interruptions, some requests<br/>*Example: Routine linen change* | **QUADRANT 4**: MINIMIZE<br/>Time wasters, busy work<br/>*Example: Reorganizing supply cart* |

### Applying to Mr. Martinez:

**QUADRANT 1 - Do Immediately:**
- Administer oxygen (SpO2 88%)
- Monitor respiratory status
- Assess ABG results
- Administer ordered medications
- IV fluid resuscitation

**QUADRANT 2 - Important but Can Wait:**
- Patient education (when stable)
- Discharge planning
- Case management consult
- Physical therapy consult
- Nutritional consult

**QUADRANT 3 - Delegate if Possible:**
- Vital signs (can delegate to CNA once stable)
- Assistance with ADLs (CNA)
- Meal tray delivery
- Transport to diagnostics (when stable)

**QUADRANT 4 - Minimize:**
- Non-essential documentation during crisis
- Social conversations
- Routine tasks that can wait

---

## Framework #4: Actual vs Risk vs Health Promotion

### Priority Order:

**1. ACTUAL Problems (Highest Priority)**
- Problems that EXIST RIGHT NOW
- Have assessment data proving they exist
- Require immediate intervention

**Example - Mr. Martinez:**
- Impaired Gas Exchange (EXISTS - SpO2 88%)
- Deficient Fluid Volume (EXISTS - dehydrated)
- Anxiety (EXISTS - restless, fearful)

---

**2. RISK Problems (Medium Priority)**
- Problems that DON'T exist yet
- Patient is vulnerable
- Prevention is the goal

**Example - Mr. Martinez:**
- Risk for Falls (hasn't fallen, but high risk)
- Risk for Skin Breakdown (skin intact, but risk factors present)

---

**3. HEALTH PROMOTION (Lower Priority)**
- Patient is doing well
- Wants to do even better
- Focus on wellness

**Example:**
- Readiness for Enhanced Self-Management
(Not applicable during Mr. Martinez's acute crisis)

---

## Framework #5: Survival Potential

### Ask: "If I don't address this, will the patient survive?"

**WILL DIE if not addressed:**
- Airway obstruction
- Respiratory failure
- Cardiac arrest
- Severe bleeding
- Severe hypoglycemia
- Anaphylaxis

→ **IMMEDIATE INTERVENTION**

---

**WILL DETERIORATE if not addressed:**
- Moderate respiratory distress
- Dehydration
- Infection
- Pain
- Fever

→ **PROMPT INTERVENTION** (within minutes to hours)

---

**WILL NOT DETERIORATE QUICKLY:**
- Anxiety (mild)
- Knowledge deficits
- Activity intolerance
- Nutrition issues (chronic)
- Social isolation

→ **PLAN INTERVENTION** (within hours to days)

---

**WILL IMPROVE ON OWN OR WITH TIME:**
- Mild discomfort
- Temporary limitations
- Expected post-procedure effects

→ **MONITOR AND SUPPORT**

---

### Mr. Martinez Analysis:

**WILL DIE:** 
- If respiratory failure progresses → respiratory arrest
Priority: **IMMEDIATE O2, monitoring, medications**

**WILL DETERIORATE:**
- If dehydration continues → thicker secretions, worse gas exchange
- If infection untreated → sepsis
Priority: **PROMPT IV fluids, antibiotics**

**WILL NOT DETERIORATE QUICKLY:**
- Social isolation
- Medication adherence issues
- Nutritional deficits (chronic)
Priority: **PLAN for discharge, but address after stabilization**

---

## Framework #6: Time-Sensitive Conditions

### Conditions Where Minutes Matter

**"Time is Tissue"**

| Condition | Window | Why It Matters |
|-----------|--------|----------------|
| **Stroke** | 3-4.5 hours | tPA window; brain cells dying |
| **MI (STEMI)** | 90 minutes | Door-to-balloon time; heart muscle dying |
| **Sepsis** | 1 hour | Each hour delay ↑ mortality 7% |
| **Respiratory Failure** | Minutes | Can progress to arrest |
| **Hemorrhage** | Minutes | Exsanguination |
| **Hypoglycemia** | 15-30 min | Brain damage from prolonged low glucose |
| **Anaphylaxis** | Minutes | Airway closes, shock develops |

**For Mr. Martinez:**
- Respiratory failure → Time-sensitive
- Sepsis risk → Time-sensitive (antibiotics within 1 hour of sepsis recognition)

**Action:** IMMEDIATE intervention, don't delay

---

## Framework #7: CURE Principle

**C** = **Critical** (Life-threatening)
**U** = **Urgent** (Could become critical)
**R** = **Routine** (Important but stable)
**E** = **Extra** (Nice to have)

### Mr. Martinez's Problems by CURE:

**CRITICAL (Do NOW):**
- Impaired Gas Exchange
- Ineffective Airway Clearance
- Ineffective Breathing Pattern

**URGENT (Do SOON):**
- Deficient Fluid Volume
- Anxiety (worsens respiratory status)
- Infection treatment

**ROUTINE (Do TODAY):**
- Activity intolerance
- Self-care deficit
- Nutritional deficit

**EXTRA (Do WHEN ABLE):**
- Patient education (when alert and less dyspneic)
- Discharge planning details
- Social work consult

---

## Framework #8: Acute vs Chronic

### Priority Rule: ACUTE problems before CHRONIC

**ACUTE Problems:**
- Recent onset
- Can be resolved or improved quickly
- Often reversible
- Require immediate attention

**CHRONIC Problems:**
- Long-standing
- Managed, not cured
- Stable (usually)
- Important but less urgent

### Mr. Martinez Example:

**ACUTE (Priority):**
- Respiratory failure ← Address FIRST
- Pneumonia ← Address FIRST
- Dehydration ← Address FIRST
- Current anxiety episode ← Address FIRST

**CHRONIC (Important but Lower Priority):**
- COPD baseline ← Manage, but can't cure
- Malnutrition ← Long-term issue
- Social isolation ← Long-standing
- General anxiety ← Baseline trait

**Exception:** If chronic problem is causing acute crisis, address both
- Example: COPD (chronic) + exacerbation (acute) → Treat exacerbation

---

## Framework #9: Systemic vs Local

### Priority: SYSTEMIC before LOCAL

**SYSTEMIC (Affects whole body):**
- Sepsis
- Respiratory failure (affects all organs via hypoxemia)
- Shock
- Electrolyte imbalances
- Acidosis/alkalosis

**LOCAL (Affects one area):**
- Wound
- Localized pain
- Peripheral IV infiltration
- Skin tear

### Mr. Martinez:

**SYSTEMIC:**
- Respiratory failure (all organs need oxygen) ← PRIORITY
- Infection (could become sepsis)
- Dehydration (affects multiple systems)

**LOCAL:**
- IV site (monitor, but not priority)

---

## Framework #10: Direct vs Indirect Problems

### Priority: DIRECT life threats before INDIRECT

**DIRECT Threats:**
- The problem itself is immediately dangerous
- Example: Airway obstruction, hemorrhage, MI

**INDIRECT Threats:**
- The problem leads to something dangerous
- Example: Immobility → Risk for skin breakdown

### Mr. Martinez:

**DIRECT:**
- Impaired Gas Exchange ← The hypoxemia itself is dangerous
- Respiratory acidosis ← The pH itself is dangerous

**INDIRECT:**
- Immobility → leads to → Risk for skin breakdown
- Anxiety → worsens → Dyspnea

**Note:** Anxiety in this case is both direct (causes suffering) and indirect (worsens breathing). Address it early.

---

## Multiple Patient Scenarios

### Scenario 1: You Have 4 Patients

**Who do you see FIRST?**

**Patient A:** 45-year-old post-op day 1, stable vital signs, requesting pain medication, pain 6/10

**Patient B:** 68-year-old with COPD, SpO2 89%, respiratory rate 26, appears anxious

**Patient C:** 55-year-old diabetic, blood glucose 250 mg/dL, asking about breakfast

**Patient D:** 72-year-old with dementia, daughter at bedside asking questions about discharge

<details>
<summary>Click for answer</summary>

**Priority Order:**

**1. Patient B (COPD, SpO2 89%)** 
- **Why:** Breathing problem, ABC priority
- **Action:** Assess respiratory status, apply oxygen if ordered, determine if deteriorating

**2. Patient A (Pain 6/10)**
- **Why:** Pain is actual problem affecting patient now; comfort is important
- **Action:** Administer pain medication (after assessing patient B is stable)

**3. Patient C (BG 250 mg/dL)**
- **Why:** Elevated but not immediately dangerous (no DKA symptoms mentioned)
- **Action:** Check if insulin ordered, coordinate with meal tray

**4. Patient D (Discharge questions)**
- **Why:** Important but not urgent; family education can wait
- **Action:** Acknowledge daughter, let her know you'll return when able

**Rationale:** 
- ABCs prioritize Patient B
- Actual problems (A & C) before questions (D)
- Pain deserves prompt attention once breathing patient is stable
- Hyperglycemia at 250 is concerning but not immediately life-threatening

</details>

---

### Scenario 2: Competing Priorities

**You're caring for Mr. Martinez. Which do you do FIRST?**

**Option A:** Give scheduled albuterol inhaler (due now)

**Option B:** Help him to bathroom (he's been asking for 10 minutes)

**Option C:** Check on new lab results that just posted (physician called about them)

**Option D:** Answer call light from next patient (non-urgent request)

<details>
<summary>Click for answer</summary>

**Answer: Depends on context, but likely A or C**

**Best approach:**
1. **Quickly triage all four:**
   - How urgent is the inhaler? (Is he deteriorating? Is this rescue medication?)
   - How urgent is bathroom? (Risk of incontinence? Fall risk if he goes alone?)
   - What labs? (Critical values? Routine?)
   - What's the call light? (Usually someone else can get it)

2. **Likely priority:**
   - **If labs are CRITICAL values:** C first (may need immediate action)
   - **If labs are routine:** A first (bronchodilator will help breathing)
   - **Then:** B (don't make him wait too long - dignity + fall risk)
   - **Delegate:** D to another staff member

**Key Point:** Use clinical judgment based on full context. In respiratory distress, bronchodilator is high priority. But critical lab values might require immediate intervention.

</details>

---

### Scenario 3: Morning Rounds

**You arrive at 7 AM. Which do you assess FIRST?**

**Patient 1:** 70-year-old post-CABG day 2, sitting up eating breakfast, watching TV

**Patient 2:** 55-year-old with pneumonia, CNA reports "seems more confused this morning"

**Patient 3:** 80-year-old fall risk, sleeping peacefully, bed alarm on

**Patient 4:** 45-year-old diabetic, scheduled for discharge today, asking about paperwork

<details>
<summary>Click for answer</summary>

**Priority: Patient 2 (New confusion)**

**Why:**
- **Change in mental status = RED FLAG**
- Could indicate:
  - Hypoxemia (respiratory distress)
  - Hypoglycemia
  - Infection/sepsis
  - Stroke
  - Medication reaction
  - Electrolyte imbalance

**Action:** 
1. Immediate assessment of Patient 2:
   - Vital signs (especially SpO2, BP, glucose)
   - Neuro assessment (orientation, speech, motor)
   - Review overnight events
   - Check medications given

2. Then assess others:
   - Patient 1: Stable, continue with routine assessment
   - Patient 3: Sleeping with safety measures in place - check but not urgent
   - Patient 4: Important but not urgent

**Key Point:** ANY change in mental status requires immediate assessment.

</details>

## Special Populations: Prioritization Adjustments

### Pediatrics
**Adjustments:**
- Small bodies decompensate FASTER
- Respiratory distress can progress to arrest quickly
- Dehydration more dangerous (smaller fluid reserves)
- **Priority:** Even more aggressive with ABC issues

---

### Geriatrics (Like Mr. Martinez)
**Adjustments:**
- May not show typical signs of distress
- Baseline may be different (lower BP, slower HR)
- Multiple chronic conditions complicate picture
- Falls are major risk
- **Priority:** Establish baseline, prevent decompensation, prevent falls

---

### Obstetrics
**Adjustments:**
- Two patients (mother and baby)
- Normal vital signs are different in pregnancy
- Certain conditions time-sensitive (eclampsia, abruption, hemorrhage)
- **Priority:** Consider impact on fetus

---

### Mental Health
**Adjustments:**
- Safety is paramount (suicide risk, violence risk)
- Physical health problems often present
- Don't assume symptoms are "just psychiatric"
- **Priority:** Safety first, then address acute physical needs

---

## Red Flags: ALWAYS Priority

### Stop What You're Doing - Assess IMMEDIATELY

- 🚨 **Chest pain** (especially with diaphoresis, radiation, SOB)
- 🚨 **Sudden change in mental status** (confusion, unresponsiveness)
- 🚨 **Difficulty breathing** (SpO2 dropping, increased effort)
- 🚨 **Severe bleeding** (active hemorrhage)
- 🚨 **Seizure activity**
- 🚨 **Severe allergic reaction** (hives, swelling, difficulty breathing)
- 🚨 **Blood glucose < 60 or > 400** (with symptoms)
- 🚨 **Fever > 100.4°F in immunocompromised** (sepsis risk)
- 🚨 **New onset severe headache** ("worst headache of my life")
- 🚨 **Loss of consciousness** (even if brief)
- 🚨 **Sudden numbness/weakness** (stroke alert)
- 🚨 **Abnormal vital signs:**
  - SpO2 < 90%
  - HR < 50 or > 120
  - Systolic BP < 90 or > 180
  - Temp > 103°F or < 96°F
  - RR < 10 or > 30

**Action:** Activate rapid response team if appropriate, call for help, stay with patient

---

## Decision-Making Algorithm

### When You Have Multiple Priorities:

```
START
  ↓
Is there an IMMEDIATE life threat?
(Airway, Breathing, Circulation)
  ↓
YES → Address IMMEDIATELY
  ↓
NO → Continue
  ↓
Which problem is most URGENT?
(Will deteriorate fastest if not addressed)
  ↓
Address MOST URGENT first
  ↓
Which problem affects MOST SYSTEMS?
(Systemic vs local)
  ↓
Address SYSTEMIC problem
  ↓
Which is ACTUAL vs RISK?
  ↓
Address ACTUAL problem
  ↓
Which problem, if resolved, will improve OTHERS?
  ↓
Address the ROOT CAUSE
  ↓
Reassess and REPRIORITIZE
(Priorities change as condition changes)
```

## Application: Mr. Martinez's Care Priority

### Hour 1 (Immediate - Life Threat):

1. ✓ **Apply oxygen** (SpO2 88% - immediately life-threatening)
2. ✓ **Continuous monitoring** (pulse ox, telemetry, frequent VS)
3. ✓ **Position for optimal breathing** (high Fowler's, supported)
4. ✓ **Administer emergency medications** (albuterol, ipratropium)
5. ✓ **Establish IV access** (for medications and fluids)
6. ✓ **Notify physician** (respiratory failure)
7. ✓ **Stay with patient** (airway/breathing priority)

---

### Hour 2-4 (Urgent - Stabilization):

1. ✓ **IV fluids** (dehydration worsens secretions)
2. ✓ **Antibiotics** (within 1 hour of sepsis recognition)
3. ✓ **Corticosteroids** (reduce airway inflammation)
4. ✓ **Anxiety management** (breaks dyspnea-anxiety cycle)
5. ✓ **Airway clearance** (suction if needed, encourage coughing)
6. ✓ **Assess response** (SpO2, work of breathing, ABG)

---

### Hours 4-24 (Important - Continued Treatment):

1. ✓ **Continue respiratory treatments**
2. ✓ **Wean oxygen** (as tolerated)
3. ✓ **Monitor for complications**
4. ✓ **Nutrition** (when breathing improved enough to eat)
5. ✓ **Activity progression** (dangling, chair, ambulation)
6. ✓ **Sleep/rest** (cluster care, quiet environment)

---

### Day 2-3 (Routine - Recovery):

1. ✓ **PT/OT consults** (activity tolerance, ADL training)
2. ✓ **Patient education** (when alert and less anxious)
3. ✓ **Medication teaching**
4. ✓ **Incentive spirometry** (prevent complications)

---

### Day 3-Discharge (Planning):

1. ✓ **Discharge planning** (services, support)
2. ✓ **Case management** (resources, transportation)
3. ✓ **Social work** (financial assistance)
4. ✓ **Follow-up appointments**
5. ✓ **Home health referrals**

---

## Key Takeaways: Prioritization Principles

✓ **ABC = Always Be Considering** Airway, Breathing, Circulation

✓ **"What will kill my patient first?"** = Guide your priorities

✓ **Actual problems before risk problems**

✓ **Acute before chronic**

✓ **Systemic before local**

✓ **Address root causes** that worsen multiple problems

✓ **Time-sensitive conditions** require immediate action

✓ **Physiological needs** before psychosocial (Maslow)

✓ **Priorities CHANGE** - reassess constantly

✓ **One intervention can address multiple problems** (Example: O2 helps gas exchange, reduces anxiety, improves activity tolerance)

✓ **Don't forget prevention** - Address risks before they become actual problems

✓ **Use multiple frameworks** - They complement each other

✓ **Trust your gut** - If something feels wrong, investigate immediately

✓ **You can't do everything** - Delegate, ask for help, be realistic

✓ **Documentation can wait** - Patient safety cannot

## Critical Thinking: Practice Questions

### Question 1
Patient has chest pain AND needs to void. Which first?

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

**Chest pain FIRST**

Chest pain could be MI = life-threatening (Circulation)
Needing to void = discomfort but not immediately life-threatening

**BUT:** Offer bedpan/urinal so patient doesn't strain (Valsalva could worsen cardiac status)

</details>

---

### Question 2
Patient with COPD: SpO2 90% (baseline 92%) vs Patient with no lung disease: SpO2 90%

Who is priority?

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

**Patient WITH NO LUNG DISEASE is higher priority**

- COPD patient: 90% might be near their baseline (only 2% drop)
- Healthy patient: 90% is significantly abnormal (should be 95-100%)
- More concerning change = more urgent

**Key Point:** Always consider baseline when prioritizing

</details>

---

### Question 3
Your shift priorities:

- A: Give 0800 medications (now 0810)
- B: Wound dressing change (ordered for 0800)
- C: Patient requesting pain medication (8/10 pain)
- D: IV pump beeping "occlusion"

What order?

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

**Order: D, C, A, B**

**D (IV occlusion):** 
- FIRST - Could be infiltrating, IV might be lost, patient not getting ordered meds/fluids
- Takes 30 seconds to assess

**C (Pain 8/10):**
- SECOND - Actual problem, patient suffering
- After confirming IV works, can give pain meds

**A (Medications):**
- THIRD - Slightly late but need to give
- 10 minutes late is reasonable given other priorities

**B (Dressing change):**
- FOURTH - Important but can wait another 30-60 minutes
- Wound isn't getting worse in that time

</details>

---

## Remember

**Good prioritization is:**
- ✓ Systematic (use frameworks)
- ✓ Flexible (adapt as situation changes)
- ✓ Patient-centered (what matters most to THIS patient)
- ✓ Evidence-based (use assessment data)
- ✓ Realistic (acknowledge limitations)

**Poor prioritization is:**
- ✗ Random (doing whatever comes up)
- ✗ Rigid (not reassessing)
- ✗ Task-focused (focusing on tasks instead of patient needs)
- ✗ Assumption-based (not using data)
- ✗ Perfectionist (trying to do everything immediately)

---

## Next Steps

Now that you understand prioritization frameworks, you're ready to:

**→ Continue to Document 04: Care Planning (Goals & Outcomes)**

You'll use your prioritized nursing diagnoses to develop specific, measurable goals and create a comprehensive care plan that addresses problems in order of urgency.
