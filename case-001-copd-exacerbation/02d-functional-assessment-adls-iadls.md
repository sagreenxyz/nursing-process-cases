# Functional Assessment: ADLs & IADLs

## Overview

**Functional Assessment** evaluates a patient's ability to perform **Activities of Daily Living (ADLs)** and **Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADLs)**. This assessment is critical for:
- Discharge planning
- Determining level of care needed
- Identifying safety risks
- Measuring rehabilitation progress
- Evaluating independence

**Why Functional Assessment Matters:**
- ✓ Predicts ability to live independently
- ✓ Identifies need for assistive devices or caregiver support
- ✓ Establishes rehabilitation goals
- ✓ Required for insurance/reimbursement
- ✓ Measures impact of illness on daily life

---

## ADLs vs IADLs: What's the Difference?

### Activities of Daily Living (ADLs)
**Basic self-care tasks required for independent living**

The **Katz Index** identifies 6 basic ADLs:
1. Bathing
2. Dressing
3. Toileting
4. Transferring (mobility)
5. Continence
6. Feeding

**Why These Matter:**
- Most fundamental survival skills
- Loss indicates need for personal care assistance
- Used to determine nursing home placement eligibility
- Inability = high dependency

---

### Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADLs)
**Complex tasks required for independent community living**

The **Lawton-Brody Scale** identifies 8 IADLs:
1. Using telephone
2. Shopping
3. Food preparation
4. Housekeeping
5. Laundry
6. Transportation
7. Managing medications
8. Managing finances

**Why These Matter:**
- Required for living independently in community
- Lost earlier than ADLs (more complex)
- Loss indicates need for supportive services
- Inability = may need assisted living or supervision

## Functional Decline: Acute vs Chronic

### Understanding the Pattern

**Chronic Baseline Decline (COPD Impact):**
- Progressive loss of IADLs over past 2-3 years
- Modified independence in basic ADLs
- Adapted to limitations but declining

**Acute Decline (Current Exacerbation):**
- Sudden loss of ADL independence
- Complete dependence for bathing, dressing
- Requires assist for toileting, transfers, feeding
- Expected to IMPROVE with treatment

**Recovery Trajectory:**
```
Pre-COPD Function (years ago)
        ↓
    [Gradual COPD decline]
        ↓
Baseline before admission (modified independence)
        ↓
    [Acute illness]
        ↓
Current admission (severe dependence) ← WE ARE HERE
        ↓
    [Treatment & recovery]
        ↓
Goal: Return to baseline (modified independence)
        ↓
    [Ongoing COPD progression]
        ↓
Future: Further decline (expected with COPD)
```

---

## Rehabilitation Potential

**Factors Supporting Recovery:**
- ✓ Intact cognition
- ✓ Motivated ("I want to go home")
- ✓ Maintained continence despite illness
- ✓ Baseline was modified independence (achievable goal)
- ✓ Understands his condition
- ✓ Willing to use assistive devices/accept help

**Factors Limiting Recovery:**
- ⚠️ Chronic progressive disease (COPD)
- ⚠️ Malnutrition/cachexia
- ⚠️ Deconditioning
- ⚠️ Lack of social support
- ⚠️ Multiple barriers (transportation, finances)
- ⚠️ Depression risk (isolation, losses)

**Realistic Goal:** Return to baseline modified independence with increased support services

---

- May eventually need assisted living

---

## Functional Goals

### Short-Term Goals (By Discharge):

**ADLs:**
- Patient will perform bathing with standby assistance and adaptive equipment
- Patient will dress upper body independently, require assist with lower body
- Patient will transfer with minimal assistance and walker
- Patient will feed self with rest breaks and supplementation

**IADLs:**
- Patient/family will verbalize discharge medication plan with delivery arranged
- Patient will identify transportation resources for follow-up appointments
- Patient will have meal delivery arranged

### Long-Term Goals (Post-Discharge):

- Return to baseline modified independence in ADLs within 2-4 weeks
- Establish reliable medication procurement and adherence
- Maintain adequate nutrition with meal assistance
- Prevent readmission through support service utilization
- Maximize quality of life despite chronic illness limitations

## Critical Thinking Questions

**Question 1:** Mr. Martinez was managing at home before this admission despite significant functional impairments. What changed?

<details>
<summary>Click for answer</summary>

He was at the "edge" of managing - barely compensated. The **acute pneumonia/exacerbation** tipped him over the edge. 

**Key Point:** Patients with chronic illness often live in fragile equilibrium. A small acute illness can cause disproportionate functional decline. This is why **preventing exacerbations** is critical - each one causes decline that may not fully recover.

</details>

**Question 2:** Why is the functional assessment MORE important than the medical diagnosis for discharge planning?

<details>
<summary>Click for answer</summary>

**Medical diagnosis** tells you the disease. **Functional assessment** tells you if the patient can survive at home.

Two patients with identical COPD severity may have completely different functional abilities depending on:
- Social support
- Financial resources  
- Home environment
- Comorbidities
- Cognitive status

**Functional assessment identifies discharge barriers** that must be addressed or patient will return to hospital.

</details>

---

## Key Takeaways

✓ **Functional assessment predicts discharge needs** better than medical diagnosis alone

✓ **ADL impairment indicates need for hands-on care** (personal care assistance)

✓ **IADL impairment indicates need for support services** (meals, transport, housekeeping)

✓ **Distinguish acute from chronic decline** - different implications for recovery

✓ **Identify barriers, not just deficits** - transportation and financial barriers are as important as physical limitations

✓ **Functional impairment impacts health** - inability to shop/cook → malnutrition → worse COPD → hospitalization

✓ **Discharge without addressing functional needs = readmission**

✓ **Independence is relative** - modified independence with support services is a realistic and dignified goal
