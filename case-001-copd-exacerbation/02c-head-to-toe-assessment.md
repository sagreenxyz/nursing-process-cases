# Head-to-Toe Physical Assessment

## Overview

**Head-to-Toe Assessment** is a systematic, organized physical examination proceeding from head to feet. This is the most fundamental nursing assessment skill and is used universally across all clinical settings.

**Why Head-to-Toe?**
- ✓ **Systematic** - ensures nothing is missed
- ✓ **Efficient** - organized workflow minimizes patient repositioning
- ✓ **Universal** - understood across all healthcare disciplines
- ✓ **Baseline** - establishes comprehensive baseline for comparison
- ✓ **Adaptable** - can be abbreviated or expanded based on situation

**When to Use:**
- Admission assessments
- Beginning of shift assessments
- Post-procedure monitoring
- Any time comprehensive physical exam is needed

## Head & Neck

### Neurological - Head

**Level of Consciousness:**
- Alert and oriented to person, place, time, situation
- Responds appropriately to questions
- Speech coherent but limited to 3-4 word sentences due to dyspnea
- No confusion, lethargy, or obtundation

**Cranial Nerves (Screening):**
- CN II, III, IV, VI: Pupils PERRLA (3mm → 2mm), extraocular movements intact
- CN V, VII: Facial sensation intact, facial symmetry present
- CN IX, X: Gag reflex present, uvula midline
- CN XII: Tongue midline

**Assessment:** Neurological function intact despite severe hypoxemia - **significant positive finding**

---

### Head - Inspection & Palpation

**Skull:**
- Normocephalic
- No lesions, lumps, or tenderness
- Hair thinning, clean

**Face:**
- Symmetrical
- Anxious facial expression
- No facial droop or asymmetry
- Skin color: Pale with slight cyanosis around lips

**Eyes:**
- Conjunctiva: Slightly pale (possible anemia or chronic hypoxia)
- Sclera: White, no jaundice
- Pupils: PERRLA
- Visual acuity: Wears glasses for reading
- No drainage or redness
- Dark circles under eyes (fatigue, sleep deprivation)

**Ears:**
- External ear: Normal appearance, no lesions
- Hearing: Intact to conversation
- No drainage

**Nose:**
- Nares patent bilaterally
- No flaring noted at rest (but may occur with exertion)
- Nasal mucosa pink
- No epistaxis
- Nasal cannula in place (2L O2 applied after initial assessment)

**Mouth & Throat:**
- Lips: Pursed-lip breathing observed, slight cyanosis
- Mucous membranes: Pale pink, slightly dry (dehydration)
- Tongue: Midline, slightly dry coating
- Teeth: Multiple missing, poor dentition
- Dentures: Upper denture, fits poorly
- Gums: No bleeding or inflammation
- Pharynx: No erythema, no exudate
- Tonsils: Not enlarged
- Uvula: Midline
- Gag reflex: Present

**Clinical Significance:** Poor dentition may impact nutrition. Dry mucous membranes confirm dehydration. Lip cyanosis indicates hypoxemia.

---

### Neck

**Inspection:**
- Symmetrical, no masses
- Trachea midline (important - deviation suggests pneumothorax or mass)
- Slight jugular venous distention (JVD) at 30 degrees elevation
- No lymphadenopathy

**Palpation:**
- Lymph nodes: Not palpable or tender
- Thyroid: Not enlarged, no nodules
- Carotid pulses: 2+ bilaterally, no bruits
- No tenderness

**Range of Motion:**
- Deferred due to respiratory distress
- Patient maintaining tripod position

**Clinical Significance:** Slight JVD suggests mild right heart strain (cor pulmonale from COPD). Midline trachea rules out tension pneumothorax.

---

## Chest & Respiratory System

### Inspection

**Chest Configuration:**
- **Barrel chest** - increased anterior-posterior diameter (classic COPD finding)
- Ribs horizontal rather than downward slope
- Costal angle >90 degrees

**Breathing Pattern:**
- Rate: 28 breaths/min (normal: 12-20)
- Rhythm: Regular
- Depth: Shallow
- **Prolonged expiratory phase** (I:E ratio approximately 1:4 - normal is 1:2)
- Symmetrical chest expansion (limited)
- **Use of accessory muscles** - sternocleidomastoid, scalenes, intercostals actively contracting
- **Tripod position** - leaning forward on arms to maximize accessory muscle use
- **Pursed-lip breathing** - intermittent (patient compensating)
- Paradoxical breathing: None (good - absence of respiratory muscle fatigue)

**Effort of Breathing:**
- Labored, appears exhausting
- Retraction: Supraclavicular and intercostal retractions visible
- Patient appears unable to sustain this level of work indefinitely

**Cough:**
- Productive
- Frequency: Frequent
- Quality: Weak cough effort (fatigued)
- Sputum: Yellow-green, thick, approximately 2 tablespoons produced

**Clinical Significance:** Barrel chest indicates chronic disease. Accessory muscle use, tachypnea, and prolonged expiration indicate severe airway obstruction.

---

### Palpation

**Chest Wall:**
- No tenderness, crepitus, or masses
- No subcutaneous emphysema
- Tactile fremitus: Diminished bilaterally (air trapping in COPD)
- Chest expansion: Symmetrical but limited (<3cm - normal is 3-5cm)

---

### Percussion

**Technique:** Percuss systematically comparing side-to-side

**Findings:**
- **Hyperresonance** throughout all lung fields bilaterally
- No dullness (no consolidation or effusion in upper/middle fields)
- Slight dullness at right base (correlates with RLL infiltrate on X-ray)
- Diaphragmatic excursion: Limited (flattened diaphragm from COPD)

**Clinical Significance:** Hyperresonance indicates air trapping (COPD). Dullness at right base confirms pneumonia.

---

### Auscultation

**Technique:** Listen systematically, anterior and posterior, comparing side-to-side. Use diaphragm of stethoscope.

**Breath Sounds:**
- **Quality:** Diminished bilaterally throughout (reduced air movement)
- **Symmetry:** Symmetrical but equally diminished
- **Inspiration:** Decreased volume
- **Expiration:** Prolonged (wheezing throughout)

**Adventitious Sounds:**

| Location | Sound | Timing | Clears with Cough? |
|----------|-------|--------|-------------------|
| Throughout all fields | Expiratory wheezes (high-pitched) | Expiration | No |
| Bilateral bases | Coarse crackles | Inspiration | Partial |
| Right lower lobe | Crackles more pronounced | Inspiration | No |

**Voice Sounds:**
- Bronchophony: Increased at right base (consolidation)
- Egophony: Possible at right base (consolidation)
- Whispered pectoriloquy: Deferred (patient too dyspneic)

**Clinical Significance:** Wheezes indicate bronchospasm. Crackles indicate secretions and/or fluid (infection at right base). Diminished sounds indicate poor air movement - concerning finding.

---

## Cardiovascular System

### Inspection

**Precordium:**
- No visible pulsations
- No heaves or lifts
- Point of maximal impulse (PMI): Not visible

**Extremities:**
- **Nail beds:** Clubbing present (chronic hypoxia)
- Color: Slightly cyanotic nail beds
- No peripheral edema in lower extremities
- No varicosities noted

---

### Palpation

**Pulses:** Assess rate, rhythm, equality, amplitude (scale 0-4+)

| Pulse Site | Right | Left | Quality |
|------------|-------|------|---------|
| Carotid | 2+ | 2+ | Regular, equal |
| Brachial | 2+ | 2+ | Regular, equal |
| Radial | 2+ | 2+ | Regular, equal |
| Femoral | 2+ | 2+ | Regular, equal |
| Popliteal | 2+ | 2+ | Regular, equal |
| Dorsalis pedis | 2+ | 2+ | Regular, equal |
| Posterior tibial | 2+ | 2+ | Regular, equal |

**PMI:**
- Located at 5th intercostal space, midclavicular line
- Non-displaced (normal)
- No heaves, thrills, or lifts

**Extremities:**
- Skin temperature: Warm bilaterally
- Capillary refill: <3 seconds bilaterally (normal)
- No edema (0/4+ bilaterally)
- No tenderness or cords

**Clinical Significance:** Peripheral perfusion adequate despite hypoxemia. Clubbing confirms chronic hypoxia. No edema suggests heart currently compensating.

---

### Auscultation

**Heart Sounds:**
- Rate: 108 bpm (regular rhythm)
- Rhythm: Regular, no irregular beats
- **S1:** Present, normal intensity
- **S2:** Present, normal intensity
- **S3:** Not auscultated
- **S4:** Not auscultated
- **Murmurs:** None detected
- **Rubs or gallops:** None

**Auscultation sites assessed:**

- Pulmonic (2nd ICS, left sternal border)
- Erb's point (3rd ICS, left sternal border)
- Tricuspid (4th ICS, left sternal border)
- Mitral (5th ICS, midclavicular line)

**Clinical Significance:** Regular rhythm with tachycardia is compensatory response to hypoxemia. No murmurs or extra heart sounds is reassuring.

---

## Abdomen

### Inspection

**Contour:** Flat, scaphoid (thin)
**Skin:** Intact, no rashes or lesions
**Symmetry:** Symmetrical
**Umbilicus:** Midline, no herniation
**Pulsations:** Aortic pulsation faintly visible (normal in thin individuals)
**Distention:** None
**Scars:** Old appendectomy scar, right lower quadrant
**Ostomy/tubes:** None

---

### Auscultation (ALWAYS before palpation)

**Bowel Sounds:**
- Present in all four quadrants
- Frequency: Normoactive (5-30 per minute)
- Character: Normal pitch and tone
- No bruits over aorta, renal, or femoral arteries

---

### Percussion

**Technique:** Percuss all four quadrants systematically

**Findings:**

- Liver span: 10 cm at right midclavicular line (normal: 6-12 cm)
- No dullness suggesting masses or fluid
- No shifting dullness (no ascites)
- Spleen: Not percussible (normal)

---

### Palpation

**Light Palpation:**

- No deep tenderness
- No masses or organomegaly
- Liver edge: Not palpable below costal margin (normal)
- Spleen: Not palpable (normal)
- Kidneys: Not palpable (normal)
- Bladder: Not palpable (empty)

**Special Tests:**
- Murphy's sign: Negative
- Rovsing's sign: N/A (has appendectomy scar)
- Rebound tenderness: Negative

**Clinical Significance:** Abdomen benign - no acute abdominal pathology. Normal bowel sounds indicate GI function intact.

---

## Genitourinary System

*(External exam only in ED setting; full exam deferred)*

**Inspection:**
- External genitalia: Deferred to privacy unless indicated
- Urinary meatus: No catheter present
- No visible lesions or discharge

**Voiding Pattern:**
- Last void: 6 hours ago (oliguria concerning)
- Amount: Small
- Color: Dark yellow (concentrated)
- No dysuria, urgency, or frequency reported
- No incontinence

**Clinical Significance:** Oliguria and concentrated urine confirm dehydration. No signs of urinary retention or infection.

---

## Musculoskeletal System

### Inspection

**Posture:**
- Currently in tripod position (leaning forward on arms)
- Unable to assess normal posture due to respiratory distress
- Kyphosis: Slight thoracic kyphosis noted (age-related)

**Gait:**
- Not assessed (patient unable to ambulate due to dyspnea)
- Reports usually ambulates independently at baseline

**Muscle Mass:**
- **Muscle wasting evident** - temporal wasting, intercostal spaces prominent
- Cachexia throughout
- Poor muscle tone (chronic illness, malnutrition)

**Extremities:**
- Symmetrical
- No obvious deformities
- No joint swelling or erythema

---

### Palpation & Range of Motion

**Limited Assessment Due to Respiratory Distress**

**Upper Extremities:**
- Shoulders: No tenderness, currently supporting body weight in tripod position
- Elbows: No tenderness or deformity
- Wrists: No tenderness, edema, or deformity
- Hands: No joint tenderness, able to grip
- Hand grip strength: Weak bilaterally (2/5) - likely from fatigue

**Lower Extremities:**
- Hips: No tenderness noted
- Knees: No swelling, tenderness, or deformity
- Ankles: No edema
- Feet: No deformities

**Range of Motion:**
- Deferred for most joints due to patient condition
- Hands: Able to flex and extend fingers
- Full ROM assessment planned when patient stabilized

**Clinical Significance:** Muscle wasting indicates chronic malnutrition (common in COPD). Weakness from acute illness superimposed on chronic deconditioning. Functional capacity severely limited.

---

## Integumentary System

### Skin Assessment

**Color:**
- Overall: Pale
- Face: Slight circumoral cyanosis (around mouth)
- Nail beds: Cyanotic, bluish tinge
- Mucous membranes: Pale pink

**Temperature:**
- Forehead: Warm to touch (fever)
- Extremities: Warm (adequate perfusion)

**Moisture:**
- Dry overall
- No diaphoresis noted (despite fever - may indicate dehydration)

**Texture:**
- Rough, dry (dehydration)
- Thin skin (aging, chronic illness)

**Turgor:**
- **Poor skin turgor** - tenting present when skin pinched on forearm
- Returns to normal slowly (>3 seconds) - **indicates dehydration**

**Integrity:**
- Intact, no open wounds
- No pressure injuries
- No rashes or lesions
- Old surgical scar, right lower quadrant (well-healed)

**Edema:**
- None present in extremities (0/4+ bilaterally)
- No facial or periorbital edema

**Nails:**
- **Clubbing present** bilaterally (chronic hypoxia)
- Angle between nail base and finger >180 degrees
- Spongy nail bed
- Cyanotic nail beds

**Hair:**
- Scalp: Thinning, clean
- Distribution: Age-appropriate male pattern

**Clinical Significance:** Cyanosis indicates severe hypoxemia. Poor skin turgor confirms dehydration. Clubbing indicates chronic hypoxia (COPD). Skin intact is positive finding - no additional complications.

---

## Posterior Assessment

*(Requires patient repositioning - assess when condition allows)*

**Back Inspection:**
