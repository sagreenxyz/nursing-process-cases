## Interventions for Each Diagnosis: Mr. Martinez

### DIAGNOSIS #1: Impaired Gas Exchange

**GOAL:** Patient will demonstrate adequate gas exchange
- SpO2 ≥92% on supplemental oxygen within 24 hours
- ABG values improving within 72 hours

---

#### INDEPENDENT INTERVENTIONS:

**1. Position patient in high Fowler's position (60-90 degrees) at all times unless contraindicated**
- **Rationale:** Maximizes lung expansion, decreases work of breathing, uses gravity to improve ventilation-perfusion matching
- **Frequency:** Maintain continuously; reassess position every 2 hours

**2. Encourage and coach pursed-lip breathing technique**
- **How:** Teach patient to inhale through nose for 2 counts, exhale through pursed lips for 4 counts
- **Rationale:** Prevents airway collapse, prolongs exhalation, reduces air trapping, decreases work of breathing
- **Frequency:** Every 2 hours while awake and PRN for dyspnea

**3. Encourage diaphragmatic breathing exercises**
- **How:** Place patient's hand on abdomen, instruct to breathe deeply so abdomen rises
- **Rationale:** Promotes use of diaphragm instead of accessory muscles, more efficient breathing
- **Frequency:** 3-4 times daily when patient able to focus

**4. Assess respiratory status every 1 hour × 4 hours, then every 4 hours if stable**
- **What to assess:** Rate, depth, rhythm, effort, use of accessory muscles, breath sounds, SpO2
- **Rationale:** Early detection of deterioration; evaluates response to interventions
- **Documentation:** Document all findings; notify provider immediately if SpO2 <88%, RR >30 or <10, or significant change in status

**5. Monitor continuous pulse oximetry with alarms set**
- **Parameters:** Set low alarm at 88%, high alarm at 100%
- **Rationale:** Allows immediate detection of desaturation; prevents hyperoxia in COPD patient
- **Action:** Respond immediately to alarms; assess patient, not just monitor

**6. Encourage fluid intake 1500-2000 mL/day (when able to tolerate oral)**
- **Rationale:** Thin secretions, easier to expectorate; improves gas exchange
- **Method:** Offer small amounts frequently; time with rest periods
- **Monitor:** Intake and output; ensure not fluid overloaded

**7. Pace activities with rest periods**
- **How:** Cluster care; allow 30-60 minute rest between activities
- **Rationale:** Reduces oxygen demand, prevents fatigue
- **Teach:** Energy conservation techniques

**8. Maintain calm, quiet environment**
- **How:** Minimize visitors if patient anxious, reduce noise, dim lights for rest
- **Rationale:** Reduces anxiety and oxygen demand
- **Note:** Balance with preventing isolation

**9. Reassure patient during dyspneic episodes**
- **How:** Stay with patient, use calm voice, coach breathing
- **Rationale:** Reduces anxiety-dyspnea cycle; promotes sense of safety
- **Communication:** "I'm here with you. Let's breathe together slowly."

**10. Monitor for signs of respiratory failure**
- **Watch for:** Increasing confusion, extreme fatigue, inability to speak, cyanosis, SpO2 not responding to oxygen
- **Rationale:** Early recognition allows for timely intervention (possible ICU transfer, intubation)
- **Action:** Activate rapid response team if indicated

---

#### DEPENDENT INTERVENTIONS:

**11. Administer oxygen therapy as ordered**
- **Start:** Typically 2-4L via nasal cannula
- **Titrate:** Per protocol or specific orders to maintain SpO2 88-92% (COPD range)
- **Rationale:** Corrects hypoxemia; controlled oxygen prevents CO2 retention
- **Caution:** COPD patients can develop CO2 narcosis with excessive oxygen
- **Monitor:** SpO2, mental status, respiratory rate; notify provider if unable to maintain target SpO2

**12. Administer bronchodilators as ordered**
- **Albuterol 2.5 mg via nebulizer** every 4 hours and PRN for wheezing/dyspnea
- **Ipratropium 0.5 mg via nebulizer** every 6-8 hours (or combined with albuterol)
- **Rationale:** Relaxes bronchial smooth muscle, improves airflow, decreases work of breathing
- **Assessment:** Auscultate lungs before and after; monitor HR (albuterol increases HR); assess for tremors
- **Hold parameters:** Notify provider if HR >120 before dose

**13. Administer corticosteroids as ordered**
- **Example:** Methylprednisolone 40-60 mg IV every 6-12 hours
- **Rationale:** Reduces airway inflammation, improves responsiveness to bronchodilators
- **Monitor:** Blood glucose (steroids increase glucose), signs of GI bleeding, mood changes
- **Patient teaching:** Explain purpose, temporary use

**14. Obtain ABG as ordered**
- **Timing:** On admission, then per orders or PRN for changes
- **Rationale:** Assesses adequacy of ventilation and oxygenation; guides oxygen therapy
- **Technique:** Radial artery (Allen's test first); apply pressure 5+ minutes post-draw
- **Action:** Review results promptly; report critical values immediately

---

#### COLLABORATIVE INTERVENTIONS:

**15. Consult respiratory therapy**
- **For:** Nebulizer treatments, airway clearance techniques, pulmonary hygiene
- **Rationale:** Specialized expertise in respiratory management
- **Coordination:** Ensure treatments scheduled to avoid disrupting rest

**16. Monitor arterial blood gases and notify provider of abnormal values**
- **Report:** pH <7.30 or >7.50, PaCO2 >55 (acute rise), PaO2 <50
- **Rationale:** Guides adjustment of oxygen therapy and may indicate need for higher level of care

---

### DIAGNOSIS #2: Ineffective Airway Clearance

**GOAL:** Patient will maintain patent airway with effective clearance of secretions
- Breath sounds improved within 24-48 hours
- Effective coughing demonstrated

---

#### INDEPENDENT INTERVENTIONS:

**1. Assess lung sounds every 4 hours and PRN**
- **What:** Auscultate all lung fields; note location and type of adventitious sounds
- **Rationale:** Tracks effectiveness of airway clearance; identifies mucus plugging
- **Document:** Specific location (RLL, LUL, etc.) and type (rhonchi, crackles, wheezes)

**2. Encourage coughing and deep breathing every 2 hours while awake**
- **Technique:** Splint chest if needed, deep breath hold 3-5 seconds, double cough
- **Rationale:** Mobilizes secretions, prevents atelectasis
- **Timing:** Coordinate with pain medication if coughing causes discomfort

**3. Instruct and encourage use of incentive spirometry**
- **Goal:** 10 breaths every hour while awake
- **Target:** Volume appropriate for patient (start low, progress as able)
- **Rationale:** Promotes deep breathing, lung expansion, mobilizes secretions
- **Teaching:** Demonstrate proper technique; observe return demonstration

**4. Encourage oral fluid intake 1500-2000 mL/day (unless contraindicated)**
- **Why:** Hydration thins secretions, making them easier to expectorate
- **How:** Small amounts frequently; patient preference for type
- **Monitor:** I&O, signs of fluid overload (unlikely given current dehydration)

**5. Teach controlled coughing technique**
- **Method:** 
  1. Sit upright
  2. Take slow deep breath
  3. Hold 3-5 seconds
  4. Cough twice ("huff" cough)
- **Rationale:** More effective than uncontrolled coughing; less exhausting
- **Practice:** Demonstrate and coach until patient can do independently

**6. Provide tissues and sputum cup at bedside**
- **Rationale:** Convenient disposal; allows inspection of sputum
- **Observe:** Color, consistency, amount (document changes)

**7. Perform chest physiotherapy if ordered or indicated**
- **Techniques:** Percussion, vibration, postural drainage
- **Timing:** Before meals or 1-2 hours after to prevent vomiting
- **Contraindications:** Check for rib fractures, osteoporosis, recent surgery
- **Rationale:** Mechanically loosens secretions

**8. Encourage position changes every 2 hours**
- **Positions:** High Fowler's, right side, left side, sitting in chair
- **Rationale:** Prevents pooling of secretions; aids drainage
- **Note:** Maintain head elevated at least 30 degrees at all times

**9. Provide humidified oxygen if patient on O2**
- **Rationale:** Prevents drying of mucous membranes; thins secretions
- **Check:** Ensure humidifier filled and functioning properly

**10. Monitor sputum characteristics**

- **Rationale:** Breaks down mucus, easier to expectorate
- **Note:** Has unpleasant odor; explain to patient

**12. Administer antibiotics as ordered**
- **Example:** Levofloxacin 750 mg IV/PO daily
- **Timing:** First dose ASAP (within 1 hour of order for suspected sepsis)
- **Rationale:** Treats bacterial pneumonia causing excess secretions
- **Monitor:** Signs of allergic reaction (patient allergic to PCN); effectiveness (decreasing WBC, fever)

**13. Administer IV fluids as ordered**
- **Example:** 0.9% Normal Saline at 100-125 mL/hour
- **Rationale:** Corrects dehydration, thins secretions
- **Monitor:** I&O, lung sounds (watch for fluid overload), IV site

**14. Suction airway if patient unable to clear secretions**
- **When:** Only if patient cannot cough effectively and has obvious secretions
- **Technique:** Oral suctioning; explain procedure first
- **Caution:** Can cause bronchospasm in COPD patient; use gentle technique
- **Monitor:** SpO2 during procedure; provide oxygen before and after

---

#### COLLABORATIVE INTERVENTIONS:

**15. Consult respiratory therapy for airway clearance techniques**
- **Options:** Flutter valve, positive expiratory pressure (PEP) device, high-frequency chest wall oscillation
- **Rationale:** Specialized devices may be more effective than traditional CPT

**16. Request sputum culture and sensitivity**
- **Timing:** Before antibiotics if possible; send if sputum changes
- **Rationale:** Identifies organism and antibiotic sensitivities; allows targeted therapy

---

### DIAGNOSIS #3: Ineffective Breathing Pattern

**GOAL:** Patient will establish effective breathing pattern
- RR 16-22 within 48 hours
- Decreased accessory muscle use

---

#### INDEPENDENT INTERVENTIONS:

**1. Monitor respiratory rate, depth, and rhythm every 1-4 hours**
- **Assess:** Rate, regularity, depth, use of accessory muscles, position needed
- **Rationale:** Detects changes; evaluates effectiveness of interventions
- **Alert:** RR >26 or <10 requires immediate assessment and provider notification

**2. Teach and encourage pursed-lip breathing (as above)**

**3. Teach energy conservation techniques**
- **Examples:**
  - Sit while doing tasks
  - Gather supplies before starting
  - Rest between activities
  - Exhale during exertion
- **Rationale:** Reduces oxygen demand, prevents dyspnea and fatigue
- **Practice:** During ADLs

**4. Coordinate activities to allow rest periods**
- **Schedule:** Space activities 30-60 minutes apart
- **Examples:** Don't bathe right after walking; give medications during bath time rather than separately
- **Rationale:** Prevents exhaustion; allows recovery between activities

**5. Position to optimize respiratory function**
- **Best:** High Fowler's (60-90 degrees)
- **Alternative:** Sitting in chair leaning forward on overbed table with pillow
- **Avoid:** Lying flat (increases work of breathing)
- **Rationale:** Maximizes diaphragm excursion and lung expansion

**6. Encourage relaxation techniques**
- **Options:** Guided imagery, progressive muscle relaxation, meditation
- **Timing:** When patient less dyspneic and able to focus
- **Rationale:** Reduces anxiety, slows respiratory rate, decreases oxygen demand

**7. Monitor for signs of respiratory fatigue**
- **Watch for:** Increasing lethargy, inability to complete sentences, decreased responsiveness
- **Rationale:** Respiratory muscle fatigue can lead to respiratory failure
- **Action:** Notify provider immediately; patient may need ventilatory support

---

#### DEPENDENT INTERVENTIONS:

**8. Administer medications as ordered** (same as Diagnosis #1)

**9. Administer anxiolytic if ordered for severe anxiety affecting breathing**
- **Example:** Lorazepam 0.5-1 mg IV/PO PRN
- **Rationale:** Reduces anxiety, decreases work of breathing
- **Caution:** Can depress respirations; monitor closely
- **Assessment:** Respiratory rate before and after administration

---

### DIAGNOSIS #4: Deficient Fluid Volume

**GOAL:** Patient will achieve adequate fluid balance
- Urine output ≥30 mL/hour
- Improved hydration markers within 24-48 hours

---

**1. Monitor intake and output every shift (every 8 hours)**
- **Record:** All PO, IV intake; all urine output, emesis, diarrhea
- **Calculate:** Running total every 24 hours
- **Rationale:** Determines fluid balance; guides fluid replacement
- **Report:** Output <30 mL/hour × 2 hours or <500 mL/24 hours

**2. Monitor vital signs every 4 hours**
- **Watch for:** HR and BP trends (improving hydration → HR decreases, BP stabilizes)
- **Rationale:** Tachycardia and hypotension improve with hydration
- **Report:** HR >110, systolic BP <100

**3. Assess hydration status every shift**
- **Check:** Skin turgor, mucous membranes, urine color/concentration, weight
- **Rationale:** Physical exam reveals hydration improvement

- **Scale:** Same scale, same clothing
- **Rationale:** Most accurate measure of fluid status
- **Goal:** Return to baseline weight or gain 2-3 lbs (lost 5 lbs from dehydration)

**5. Encourage oral fluids when able**
- **Goal:** 1500-2000 mL/day
- **Method:** Offer every 1-2 hours; small amounts frequent
- **Preferences:** Patient's preferred beverages (within diet restrictions)
- **Rationale:** Oral route preferred when patient able to tolerate
- **Note:** May need to wait until respiratory distress lessened

**6. Provide oral care every 2-4 hours**
- **Why:** Dry mouth from mouth breathing and dehydration
- **How:** Moist swabs, lip balm, gentle brushing if able
- **Rationale:** Comfort; prevents breakdown of oral mucosa

**7. Monitor for signs of fluid overload during rehydration**
- **Watch for:** Crackles in lungs, edema, dyspnea, jugular vein distension
- **Rationale:** Elderly and those with cardiac history at risk for overload
- **Action:** Slow IV rate and notify provider if signs of overload

---

#### DEPENDENT INTERVENTIONS:

**8. Administer IV fluids as ordered**
- **Example:** 0.9% Normal Saline 125 mL/hour
- **Rationale:** Rapid rehydration; ensures adequate circulating volume
- **Monitor:** IV site every 2 hours; lung sounds; edema
- **Adjust:** Per provider orders based on response

**9. Monitor laboratory values**
- **Key labs:** BUN, creatinine, electrolytes, hemoglobin, hematocrit
- **Frequency:** Daily or per orders
- **Rationale:** BUN should decrease; H&H should normalize as hemodilution occurs
- **Report:** Abnormal or worsening values

**10. Administer electrolyte replacement if ordered**
- **May need:** Potassium, magnesium (especially if getting diuretics or steroids)
- **Rationale:** Correct imbalances from dehydration or medications

---

### DIAGNOSIS #5: Anxiety

**GOAL:** Patient will demonstrate reduced anxiety
- Anxiety ≤5/10 within 4 hours
- Use one coping strategy by 24 hours

---

#### INDEPENDENT INTERVENTIONS:

- **Observe:** Restlessness, facial expression, body language
- **Rationale:** Quantifies anxiety; tracks response to interventions
- **Document:** Score and manifestations

**2. Provide calm, reassuring presence**
- **How:** Speak slowly in calm voice; make eye contact; sit at eye level
- **When:** Especially during dyspneic episodes
- **Rationale:** Nurse's calm demeanor helps patient remain calm
- **Avoid:** Appearing rushed or anxious yourself

**3. Stay with patient during episodes of severe dyspnea**
- **Why:** Fear of suffocation is terrifying; presence provides security
- **Do:** Coach breathing, provide encouragement, call for help if needed
- **Say:** "I'm here with you. You're safe. Let's breathe slowly together."
- **Rationale:** Reduces sense of panic and helplessness

**4. Explain all procedures and treatments before performing**
- **Include:** What you're doing, why, what patient will feel
- **Rationale:** Knowledge reduces fear of unknown; increases sense of control
- **Allow:** Questions; provide honest answers

**5. Teach and practice relaxation techniques**
- **Options:**
  - Deep breathing (inhale 4 counts, exhale 6 counts)
  - Progressive muscle relaxation
  - Guided imagery
  - Listening to calming music
- **When:** When patient's breathing is stable enough to learn
- **Rationale:** Gives patient tools to manage anxiety independently

**6. Encourage verbalization of fears and concerns**
- **Ask:** "What worries you most?" "What are you afraid of?"
- **Listen:** Without judgment; validate feelings
- **Rationale:** Expression of fears reduces their power; allows nurse to address specific concerns

**7. Involve patient in care decisions**
- **Examples:** "Would you like to bathe now or after your breathing treatment?"
- **Rationale:** Provides sense of control; reduces helplessness
- **Note:** Offer choices, not total freedom (give 2-3 options)

**8. Reduce environmental stimuli**
- **How:** Dim lights, reduce noise, limit visitors if patient prefers
- **When:** Especially for rest/sleep
- **Rationale:** Overstimulation increases anxiety

**9. Allow family presence if patient wishes**
- **Benefits:** Familiar faces provide comfort
- **Guidelines:** Teach family to remain calm, coach breathing
- **Caution:** Remove family if they increase patient's anxiety

**10. Recognize and break the anxiety-dyspnea cycle**
- **Explain:** "When you're anxious, you breathe faster, which makes you more short of breath, which makes you more anxious"
- **Break it:** Treat breathing problem AND anxiety simultaneously
- **Rationale:** Understanding the connection helps patient manage both

---

#### DEPENDENT INTERVENTIONS:

**11. Administer anxiolytic medication if ordered**
- **Example:** Lorazepam 0.5-1 mg PO/IV every 6-8 hours PRN
- **When:** For moderate to severe anxiety not responding to other measures
- **Rationale:** Pharmacologic management may be necessary
- **Caution:** Monitor respiratory rate (can depress breathing)
- **Assessment:** Anxiety level before and after; respiratory status

**12. Administer pain medication if pain contributing to anxiety**
- **Assess:** Is chest tightness from bronchospasm or cardiac? Pain level?
- **Rationale:** Pain increases anxiety; treating pain reduces anxiety

---

#### COLLABORATIVE INTERVENTIONS:

**13. Consult chaplain or patient's spiritual advisor if desired**
- **When:** Patient expresses spiritual concerns or requests
- **Rationale:** Spiritual support reduces existential anxiety

**14. Consider psychiatric consult if severe, persistent anxiety**

- **Rationale:** May need specialized treatment

---

### DIAGNOSIS #6: Activity Intolerance

**GOAL:** Patient will demonstrate improved activity tolerance
- Ambulate 50 feet by day 3
- Complete ADLs with pacing by discharge

---

#### INDEPENDENT INTERVENTIONS:

**1. Assess activity tolerance before and after activities**
- **Before:** Baseline vital signs, SpO2, patient's perceived exertion
- **During:** Monitor for dyspnea, fatigue, SpO2 changes
- **After:** Vital signs, SpO2, recovery time
- **Rationale:** Determines safe activity level; identifies need to modify plan

**2. Plan activities during peak medication effectiveness**
- **Timing:** 30-60 minutes after bronchodilator
- **Rationale:** Breathing easier during this time; activity better tolerated

**3. Space activities with adequate rest periods**
- **Schedule:** 30-60 minutes rest between activities
- **Cluster:** Do multiple tasks during one up-period rather than getting up multiple times
- **Rationale:** Prevents exhaustion; allows recovery

**4. Progress activity gradually**
- **Day 1:** Dangle legs at bedside, sit in chair 15-30 minutes
- **Day 2:** Ambulate to bathroom with assist, sit in chair for meals
- **Day 3:** Ambulate 20-50 feet in hallway with walker
- **Day 4+:** Increase distance as tolerated
- **Rationale:** Progressive increase builds endurance safely

**5. Teach energy conservation techniques**
- **Principles:**
  - Plan ahead
  - Sit while doing tasks
  - Slide objects rather than lift
  - Use assistive devices
  - Exhale during exertion
  - Rest before and after activities
- **Practice:** During ADLs
- **Rationale:** Reduces oxygen demand, prevents dyspnea

**6. Encourage use of supplemental oxygen during activity**
- **When:** If prescribed for activity
- **How:** Portable oxygen tank or long tubing
- **Rationale:** Maintains adequate oxygenation during increased demand

**7. Stop activity if patient experiences:**
- SpO2 drops below 88%
- Severe dyspnea
- Chest pain
- Dizziness or lightheadedness
- Heart rate >120 or doesn't return to baseline within 5 minutes
- **Action:** Return patient to rest, apply oxygen if needed, monitor, notify provider if severe

**8. Provide positive reinforcement for efforts**
- **Say:** "You're making good progress" "That's much better than yesterday"
- **Rationale:** Encouragement increases motivation; acknowledges small gains

---

#### COLLABORATIVE INTERVENTIONS:

**9. Consult physical therapy**
- **For:** Mobility assessment, safe ambulation distance, assistive device needs
- **Rationale:** Expert assessment and exercise prescription
- **Timing:** When patient medically stable (usually day 2-3)

- **Rationale:** Specialists in maximizing independence with limitations

---

### DIAGNOSIS #7: Self-Care Deficit (Bathing, Dressing)

**GOAL:** Patient will achieve maximum independence in self-care
- Participate in hygiene by day 2
- Modified independence by discharge

---

#### INDEPENDENT INTERVENTIONS:

**1. Assess patient's ability to perform self-care daily**
- **Evaluate:** What patient CAN do vs what needs assistance
- **Rationale:** Establishes baseline; identifies progress
- **Reassess:** Daily as condition improves

**2. Provide assistance based on patient's needs**
- **Level:** Total care → extensive assist → moderate assist → minimal assist → modified independence
- **Goal:** Provide help needed but encourage maximum independence
- **Rationale:** Doing too much prevents patient from regaining skills; doing too little risks safety

**3. Organize supplies before beginning**
- **Setup:** Gather all items; place within reach; open containers
- **Rationale:** Reduces energy expenditure and frustration

**4. Encourage patient to do what they can**
- **Allow:** Self-washing face, brushing teeth even if nurse does rest
- **Rationale:** Maintains dignity; promotes independence; builds strength

**5. Schedule hygiene activities after breathing treatment**
- **Timing:** 30-60 minutes after bronchodilator
- **Rationale:** Less dyspneic, better tolerance

**6. Break tasks into smaller steps with rest periods**
- **Example:** Wash upper body, rest, wash lower body, rest, dress
- **Rationale:** Prevents exhaustion; makes task manageable

**7. Provide privacy and maintain dignity**
- **How:** Close curtains, expose only area being washed, use bath blanket
- **Rationale:** Self-esteem important even during dependence

**8. Use adaptive equipment as needed**
- **Examples:** Long-handled sponge, sock aid, reacher, shower chair, raised toilet seat
- **Rationale:** Compensates for limitations; promotes independence
- **Source:** May need OT consult to identify and obtain

**9. Encourage sitting for hygiene tasks**
- **Why:** Reduces energy expenditure and dyspnea
- **Setup:** Bedside chair for bathing, sitting for dressing

**10. Provide positive feedback**
- **Acknowledge:** Efforts and progress
- **Rationale:** Increases motivation and self-esteem

---

#### COLLABORATIVE INTERVENTIONS:

**11. Consult occupational therapy for ADL assessment and training**
- **When:** Once medically stable
- **For:** Adaptive equipment recommendations, energy conservation training

---

### DIAGNOSIS #8: Imbalanced Nutrition: Less Than Body Requirements

**GOAL:** Patient will improve nutritional intake
- Consume 75% meals by day 3
- Maintain/gain weight

---

#### INDEPENDENT INTERVENTIONS:

**1. Assess nutritional status**
- **Monitor:** Daily weights, food intake percentage, albumin/prealbumin if ordered
- **Observe:** Skin integrity, muscle mass, energy level
- **Rationale:** Tracks nutritional status and intervention effectiveness

**2. Encourage small, frequent meals (6 per day instead of 3)**
- **Why:** Large meals increase dyspnea (full stomach presses on diaphragm)
- **Rationale:** Smaller meals better tolerated; reduces oxygen demand for digestion

**3. Provide high-calorie, high-protein foods**
- **Examples:** Protein shakes, eggs, cheese, peanut butter, whole milk
- **Rationale:** COPD increases calorie needs; protein prevents muscle wasting

**4. Encourage rest before meals**
- **Timing:** 30 minutes rest before eating
- **Rationale:** Less dyspneic, better able to eat

**5. Administer respiratory medications before meals**
- **Why:** Improves breathing during and after eating
- **Rationale:** Bronchodilators allow better tolerance of eating

**6. Provide supplemental oxygen during meals if needed**
- **Rationale:** Maintains oxygenation despite increased oxygen demand of eating

**7. Encourage patient to eat slowly, take small bites**
- **Why:** Reduces dyspnea; allows eating and breathing
- **Teach:** Put fork down between bites

**8. Offer favorite foods when possible**
- **Ask:** "What sounds good to you?"
- **Rationale:** More likely to eat foods they enjoy

**9. Provide mouth care before meals**
- **Why:** Improves taste; stimulates appetite
- **Rationale:** Dry mouth and medications alter taste

**10. Create pleasant eating environment**
- **How:** Clear bedside table, sit patient up, remove unpleasant items (urinal, tissues with sputum)
- **Rationale:** Appetite improves in pleasant environment

**11. Monitor food intake**
- **Document:** Percentage of meal consumed
- **Rationale:** Tracks trends; identifies if problem worsening

---

#### COLLABORATIVE INTERVENTIONS:

**12. Consult dietitian**
- **For:** Nutritional assessment, calorie needs calculation, specialized diet plan
- **Timing:** Within 24-48 hours of admission for malnourished patient

**13. Request nutritional supplements if ordered**
- **Examples:** Ensure, Boost, Carnation Instant Breakfast
- **When:** Between meals, at bedtime
- **Rationale:** Increases calorie/protein intake without large volumes

---

### DIAGNOSIS #9: Risk for Falls

**GOAL:** Patient will remain free from falls

---

#### INDEPENDENT INTERVENTIONS:

**1. Complete fall risk assessment on admission and daily**
- **Use:** Facility-specific tool (Morse Fall Scale, Hendrich II)
- **Rationale:** Quantifies risk; triggers appropriate interventions

**2. Implement fall precautions**
- **Interventions:**
  - Bed in lowest position
  - Brakes locked
  - Call light within reach (and patient knows how to use it)
  - Bedside table, phone, tissues within reach
  - Non-skid footwear
  - Clear path to bathroom
  - Night light
  - Bed alarm if high risk and patient tries to get up without assistance
- **Rationale:** Environmental modifications prevent falls

**3. Place patient close to nurses' station if high risk**
- **Rationale:** Allows frequent observation

**4. Educate patient and family about fall risk**
- **Teach:** Call for assistance before getting up (even just to bathroom)
- **Explain:** Why risk is high (weakness, hypoxemia, unfamiliar environment)
- **Rationale:** Understanding increases compliance

**5. Assist with ambulation**
- **Always:** Use gait belt; walk beside patient; ensure patient using walker correctly
- **Rationale:** Physical assistance prevents falls

**6. Keep floors dry and clutter-free**
- **Check:** After meals, after hygiene, regularly
- **Rationale:** Wet floors and clutter are trip hazards

**7. Ensure adequate lighting**
- **Especially:** Night (night light in bathroom)
- **Rationale:** Poor vision in dim light increases falls

**8. Respond promptly to call lights**
- **Rationale:** Patients attempt to get up alone if they wait too long for help

**9. Offer toileting every 2-3 hours**
- **Why:** Urgency to void is common reason patients get up alone
- **Rationale:** Scheduled toileting reduces urgent trips

**10. Review medications for fall risk**
- **High risk meds:** Anxiolytics, sedatives, opioids, antihypertensives
- **Monitor:** For dizziness, sedation, orthostatic hypotension
- **Rationale:** Medications increase fall risk

**11. Orient patient to environment**
- **Show:** How call light works, where bathroom is, where belongings are
- **Rationale:** Familiarity with environment reduces confusion

**12. Check on patient frequently (hourly rounds)**
- **The 4 Ps:** Pain, Potty, Position, Possessions within reach
- **Rationale:** Proactive rounding reduces call lights and patients getting up alone

#### COLLABORATIVE INTERVENTIONS:

**13. Consult PT for mobility assessment and assistive device**
- **For:** Determination of appropriate walker/cane; gait training

## General Nursing Interventions (Apply to All)

### Safety:
- Call light within reach at all times
- Side rails up per facility policy
- Bed in low position when not providing care

### Psychosocial:
- Treat patient with respect and dignity
- Provide emotional support
- Encourage questions
- Keep patient and family informed

### Documentation:
- Document all assessments, interventions, and patient responses
- Use specific measurable terms
- Include time of intervention

### Communication:
- Report changes in patient status promptly
- Communicate plan of care to oncoming shift
- Collaborate with interdisciplinary team

## NIC (Nursing Interventions Classification)

**What is NIC?**
- Standardized classification of nursing interventions
- Comprehensive, research-based taxonomy
- Used for documentation and research

**Major NIC Interventions for Mr. Martinez:**

**Respiratory Management (3140)**
- Positioning
- Oxygen therapy
- Airway suctioning
- Breathing exercises

**Oxygen Therapy (3320)**
- Administer supplemental oxygen
- Monitor oxygen saturation
- Adjust oxygen flow

**Airway Management (3120)**
- Encourage coughing and deep breathing
- Assist with incentive spirometry
- Suction airway PRN

**Anxiety Reduction (5820)**
- Use calm, reassuring approach
- Stay with patient during anxious episodes
- Teach relaxation techniques

**Fluid Management (4120)**
- Monitor I&O
- Administer IV fluids
- Monitor electrolytes

**Energy Management (0180)**
- Plan activities for times of peak energy
- Encourage alternating rest and activity
- Teach energy conservation

**Teaching: Disease Process (5602)**
**Teaching: Prescribed Medication (5616)**

## Rationales: Why They Matter

**Every intervention needs a rationale.**

**Rationale = The "Why"**
- Scientific basis for the intervention
- Evidence that supports the action
- Expected outcome

### Examples:

**Intervention:** Position patient in high Fowler's
**Rationale:** Maximizes lung expansion by using gravity; decreases pressure on diaphragm from abdominal organs; improves ventilation-perfusion matching

**Intervention:** Administer albuterol via nebulizer
**Rationale:** Beta-2 agonist causes bronchodilation by relaxing smooth muscle; improves airflow; decreases work of breathing; relieves bronchospasm

**Intervention:** Encourage fluid intake 1500-2000 mL/day
**Rationale:** Adequate hydration thins respiratory secretions, making them easier to expectorate; dehydration causes secretions to thicken and become difficult to clear

**Why Rationales Are Essential:**
- Demonstrates critical thinking
- Justifies the intervention
- Guides evaluation (if rationale is to thin secretions, evaluate if secretions thinned)
- Professional accountability
- Legal documentation
- Teaching tool for students

---

## Evaluation of Interventions

### After implementing interventions, evaluate:

**Was it effective?**
- Did the patient achieve the expected outcome?
- Example: After oxygen therapy, did SpO2 increase to target?

**Were there unexpected effects?**
- Did complications occur?
- Example: Did oxygen therapy cause CO2 retention?

**Does the plan need modification?**
- Are different interventions needed?
- Example: If positioning didn't relieve dyspnea enough, add relaxation techniques

**This leads to Document 06: Evaluation**

## Key Takeaways

✓ **Interventions are specific actions** with clear "who, what, when, how"

✓ **Independent interventions** don't require orders (but may require protocols)

✓ **Dependent interventions** require provider orders

✓ **Evidence-based practice** - interventions should be supported by research

✓ **Patient-centered** - involve patient in decisions when possible

✓ **Safety first** - always consider patient safety

✓ **Evaluate effectiveness** - Did the intervention work?

✓ **Rationales demonstrate critical thinking** - Know WHY you're doing what you're doing

✓ **Documentation is essential** - "If it's not documented, it wasn't done"

✓ **Prioritize interventions** - Life-threatening first, then urgent, then important

✓ **Collaborate** - Use the expertise of the interdisciplinary team

✓ **Be specific** - Vague interventions lead to inconsistent care

## Next Steps

You now have comprehensive, evidence-based interventions for each of Mr. Martinez's nursing diagnoses. These interventions address the goals and outcomes you established in Document 04.

**→ Continue to Document 06: Patient Education & Teaching Plans**

Next, you'll learn to:
- Develop comprehensive teaching plans
- Assess learning readiness
- Use effective teaching strategies
- Document patient education
- Evaluate learning outcomes

Patient education is a critical nursing intervention that deserves dedicated focus.
