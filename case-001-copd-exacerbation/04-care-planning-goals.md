# Care Planning: Goals & Outcomes

## Overview

You've assessed the patient, identified nursing diagnoses, and prioritized them. Now comes **PLANNING** - deciding what you want to achieve and how you'll get there.

**Care Planning Includes:**
1. **Setting Goals** - What do you want to accomplish?
2. **Identifying Outcomes** - How will you know if you've succeeded?
3. **Selecting Interventions** - What actions will you take? (Document 05)

**Why Care Planning Matters:**
- 🎯 Provides direction and purpose for nursing actions
- 📊 Establishes measurable criteria for success
- 👥 Ensures patient-centered care
- 📝 Creates accountability
- 🔄 Enables evaluation of effectiveness
- 💼 Meets legal and regulatory requirements
- 🤝 Facilitates communication among healthcare team

**Key Principle:**
> **"If you don't know where you're going, any road will take you there."**

## Goals vs Outcomes: What's the Difference?

### GOALS (Broader, General)
**Definition:** General statements about what you want to achieve

**Characteristics:**
- Broader and more general
- May not include specific measurements
- Describe desired direction of change
- Often longer-term

**Example:**
"Patient will demonstrate improved respiratory function."

---

### OUTCOMES (Specific, Measurable)
**Definition:** Specific, measurable criteria that indicate goal achievement

**Characteristics:**
- Specific and precise
- Include measurable criteria
- Time-bound
- Observable/quantifiable
- Sometimes called "expected outcomes" or "patient outcomes"

**Example:**
"Patient will maintain SpO2 ≥92% on room air by discharge."

---

### The Relationship

```
NURSING DIAGNOSIS
        ↓
    GOAL (general direction)
        ↓
    OUTCOMES (specific markers of success)
        ↓
    INTERVENTIONS (how to achieve outcomes)
        ↓
    EVALUATION (did we meet outcomes?)
```

**Example for Mr. Martinez:**

**Nursing Diagnosis:** Impaired Gas Exchange

**Goal:** Patient will demonstrate adequate gas exchange

**Outcomes:**
- SpO2 will be ≥92% on 2L O2 within 24 hours
- Respiratory rate will be 16-20 breaths/min within 48 hours
- ABG values will be pH 7.35-7.45, PaCO2 35-45 mmHg within 72 hours
- Patient will report decreased dyspnea within 24 hours

**Interventions:** (We'll cover these in Document 05)

---

## SMART Goals Framework

**Make your outcomes SMART:**

### S = SPECIFIC
**Who** will do **what**?

❌ **Vague:** "Patient will be better"
✓ **Specific:** "Patient will ambulate 50 feet in hallway"

---

### M = MEASURABLE
**How much? How many? How will you know?**

❌ **Not measurable:** "Patient will breathe easier"
✓ **Measurable:** "Patient SpO2 will be ≥92%"

---

### A = ACHIEVABLE/ATTAINABLE
**Is this realistic given the patient's condition?**

❌ **Unrealistic:** "Patient with COPD will have normal lung function"
✓ **Achievable:** "Patient will return to baseline SpO2 of 92%"

---

### R = RELEVANT
**Does this relate to the nursing diagnosis?**

❌ **Not relevant:** "Patient will name three types of vegetables" (for respiratory diagnosis)
✓ **Relevant:** "Patient will demonstrate pursed-lip breathing technique"

---

### T = TIME-BOUND
**By when should this be achieved?**

❌ **No timeframe:** "Patient will improve"
✓ **Time-bound:** "Patient SpO2 ≥92% within 24 hours"

---

## Writing Patient-Centered Goals

### Critical Rule: Goals are PATIENT goals, not NURSE goals

**Patient will...** ✓
**Nurse will...** ✗ (This is an intervention, not a goal)

### Examples:

| ❌ WRONG (Nurse-Focused) | ✓ RIGHT (Patient-Focused) |
|-------------------------|--------------------------|
| Nurse will monitor SpO2 | Patient will maintain SpO2 ≥92% |
| Nurse will administer oxygen | Patient will demonstrate adequate oxygenation |
| Nurse will teach breathing exercises | Patient will demonstrate pursed-lip breathing |
| Nurse will provide emotional support | Patient will verbalize decreased anxiety |

---

## Goal Components: The Formula

### Basic Formula:
```
[Patient/Subject] + [Action Verb] + [Behavior/Outcome] + [Criteria] + [Time Frame]
```

### Example Breakdown:

**"Patient will ambulate 100 feet with walker independently by discharge."**

- **Subject:** Patient
- **Action Verb:** will ambulate
- **Behavior:** 100 feet with walker
- **Criteria:** independently (without assistance)
- **Time Frame:** by discharge

---

### Action Verbs for Goals

**Use observable, measurable verbs:**

**GOOD Verbs (Observable):**
- Demonstrate
- State
- List
- Describe
- Perform
- Ambulate
- Verbalize
- Maintain
- Achieve
- Exhibit
- Identify

**AVOID Vague Verbs (Not Observable):**
- Understand (how do you measure this?)
- Know (how do you observe this?)
- Feel better (subjective, not measurable)
- Appreciate (can't measure)

**How to Fix:**
- Instead of "understand" → "explain" or "describe"
- Instead of "know" → "list" or "identify"
- Instead of "feel better" → "rate pain as ≤3/10"

---

## Short-Term vs Long-Term Goals

### SHORT-TERM GOALS

**Definition:** Achievable during current hospitalization or care episode

**Time Frame:** 
- Hours to days
- Usually during acute care admission
- Before discharge

**Purpose:**
- Immediate safety/stability
- Acute problem resolution
- Stepping stones to long-term goals

**Example - Mr. Martinez:**
"Patient will maintain SpO2 ≥92% on supplemental oxygen within 24 hours."

---

### LONG-TERM GOALS

**Definition:** Achievable over extended period, often post-discharge

**Time Frame:**
- Weeks to months
- After discharge
- Ongoing management

**Purpose:**
- Chronic disease management
- Lifestyle changes
- Prevention of complications
- Optimal health maintenance

**Example - Mr. Martinez:**
"Patient will remain free from COPD exacerbations requiring hospitalization for 6 months."

---

### How They Work Together

**Think of it as a ladder:**

```
LONG-TERM GOAL (Top of ladder)
↑
SHORT-TERM GOAL 3
↑
SHORT-TERM GOAL 2
↑
SHORT-TERM GOAL 1 (Bottom rung)
```

**Example:**

**LONG-TERM:** Patient will manage COPD independently at home for 6 months without exacerbation

**SHORT-TERM 1:** SpO2 ≥92% on O2 within 24 hours
↓
**SHORT-TERM 2:** SpO2 ≥92% on room air within 72 hours
↓
**SHORT-TERM 3:** Patient demonstrates inhaler technique correctly by discharge
↓
**SHORT-TERM 4:** Patient verbalizes when to seek medical attention by discharge

All short-term goals build toward the long-term goal.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### ❌ Mistake #1: Nurse-Focused Goals

**WRONG:** "Nurse will monitor vital signs every 4 hours"
- This is an intervention, not a patient goal

**RIGHT:** "Patient will maintain stable vital signs (RR 16-20, HR 60-100) by discharge"

---

### ❌ Mistake #2: Not Measurable

**WRONG:** "Patient will feel better"
- How do you measure "better"?

**RIGHT:** "Patient will rate dyspnea as ≤3/10 within 24 hours"

---

### ❌ Mistake #3: Not Time-Bound

**WRONG:** "Patient will improve oxygenation"
- When? Today? Next month? Ever?

**RIGHT:** "Patient will maintain SpO2 ≥92% within 24 hours"

---

### ❌ Mistake #4: Not Realistic

**WRONG:** "Patient with COPD will have normal lung function by discharge"
- COPD is chronic and irreversible

**RIGHT:** "Patient will return to baseline lung function (SpO2 ≥92%) by discharge"

---

### ❌ Mistake #5: Too Vague

**WRONG:** "Patient will have better breathing"
- What does "better" mean?

**RIGHT:** "Patient will demonstrate decreased work of breathing (RR 16-20, no accessory muscles) within 48 hours"

---

### ❌ Mistake #6: Not Patient-Centered

**WRONG:** "Physician will order appropriate medications"
- This is the physician's responsibility, not a patient goal

**RIGHT:** "Patient will report relief of dyspnea after medication administration"

---

### ❌ Mistake #7: Goal Doesn't Match Diagnosis

**WRONG:** 
- Diagnosis: Impaired Gas Exchange
- Goal: Patient will ambulate 50 feet

**RIGHT:**
- Diagnosis: Impaired Gas Exchange
- Goal: Patient will maintain adequate oxygenation (SpO2 ≥92%)

---

### ❌ Mistake #8: Using Vague Verbs

**WRONG:** "Patient will understand COPD management"
- Can't observe "understand"

**RIGHT:** "Patient will explain COPD management in own words by discharge"

---

## Revising Goals Based on Progress

### Goals Are Dynamic - They Change!

**Reasons to Revise Goals:**

1. **Patient exceeds expectations**
   - Original: "Patient will ambulate 20 feet by day 3"
   - Patient ambulates 50 feet by day 2
   - Revised: "Patient will ambulate 100 feet by discharge"

2. **Patient not meeting goals**
   - Original: "Patient will be on room air by day 3"
   - Patient still needs 3L O2 on day 3
   - Revised: "Patient will wean to 2L O2 by discharge" (more realistic)

3. **Priorities change**
   - Original focus: Respiratory status (critical)
   - Day 5: Respiratory stable, new priority: Discharge planning
   - Add: Goals for medication knowledge and home management

4. **New problems emerge**
   - New diagnosis → Need new goals
   - Example: Develops hospital-acquired C. diff → Goals for infection management

5. **Condition deteriorates**
   - May need to scale back goals
   - Focus on comfort rather than cure (in some cases)

---

## Collaborative Goal-Setting

### Include the Patient!

**Why Patient Involvement Matters:**
- ✓ Increases motivation and compliance
- ✓ Ensures goals are meaningful to patient
- ✓ Respects patient autonomy
- ✓ Identifies barriers early
- ✓ Creates partnership in care

**How to Include Patient:**

1. **Explain the diagnosis in understandable terms**
   - "Your lungs are having trouble getting oxygen into your blood"

2. **Ask what's important to THEM**
   - "What would you most like to be able to do?"
   - "What's your biggest concern right now?"

3. **Collaborate on realistic goals**
   - "Let's work on getting you breathing comfortably, then we can work on walking"

4. **Get their input on timeframes**
   - "Does this seem doable to you?"

5. **Address their barriers**
   - If patient says "I can't afford those medications," this becomes part of the plan

**Example - Mr. Martinez:**

**Nurse:** "Mr. Martinez, we've identified that your breathing is the biggest priority. What's most important to you right now?"

**Mr. Martinez:** "I just want to breathe without feeling like I'm dying. And I need to be able to go home and take care of myself."

**Nurse:** "Those are great goals. Let's start with getting your breathing better - we're aiming to get your oxygen level above 92% in the next day. Once you're breathing easier, we'll work on building your strength so you can do your daily activities. Does that sound like a good plan?"

**Mr. Martinez:** "Yes, but I'm worried about those medications. I can't afford them and I don't have a way to pick them up."

**Nurse:** "That's really important information. I'm going to have our social worker meet with you to help with the cost of medications and arrange transportation. We'll make sure you have what you need before you go home. How does that sound?"

This conversation leads to:
- Goal: Maintain SpO2 ≥92% (patient's priority)
- Goal: Return to independence in ADLs (patient's priority)
- Goal: Establish plan for medication access (patient's barrier)

## Key Takeaways

✓ **Goals are PATIENT goals** (what patient will do), not nurse goals

✓ **Use SMART criteria** - Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound

✓ **Short-term goals** build toward long-term goals

✓ **Outcomes are more specific** than goals - they're measurable markers

✓ **Include timeframes** - hours for critical issues, days for acute, weeks/months for chronic

✓ **Be realistic** - base goals on patient's baseline, not textbook normal

✓ **Involve the patient** - collaborative goals increase success

✓ **Goals are dynamic** - revise based on progress or changes

## Next Steps

You now have clear, measurable goals and outcomes for each of Mr. Martinez's nursing diagnoses. These goals provide the targets for your nursing care.

**→ Continue to Document 05: Nursing Interventions**

Next, you'll learn to:
- Select evidence-based nursing interventions
- Write specific nursing orders
- Provide rationales for each intervention
- Prioritize and sequence interventions
- Address each goal with appropriate actions

The interventions are HOW you'll help Mr. Martinez achieve these goals.

**Remember:** "Goals without plans are just wishes. Plans without goals are just tasks. Together, they create purposeful, patient-centered nursing care."
